Great documentation is critical for guiding those who will use our tech stack. It should be clear, easy to read, and as detailed as required while avoiding unnecessary verbosity. This way, developers can quickly understand how to use and what to expect from our products.

From a user's perspective:

- If they can't find information about a feature in the documentation, it means that **the feature doesn't exist**.
- If there is information about a feature, but it's wrong or confusing, it means that **the feature is broken**.
- If the documentation is hard to read, it means that **the feature is hard to use**.

Be mindful of any feedback you receive from users, and let it guide you to improve the documentation. The eyes of the uninitiated are the best tool for identifying areas in need of enhancement. Though existing documentation may not yet conform to this standard, all new documentation should be written following the guidelines below, and existing documentation updated to match when time permits.

**These guidelines are currently a work in progress.** Please also refer to https://alistapart.com/article/the-ten-essentials-for-good-api-documentation/ as a good foundation.

## Structure

- Generally, individual API methods should be placed in their own `index.mdx` file, within a folder named after the method.
  - The `index.mdx` file should contain a heading with the method name and a description of the method.
  - Each file should contain a code block with at least one example of how to make a complete request, including all required parameters.
  - Where a request includes optional parameters which will result in different response structures, the file should contain a code block for each possible request variation, followed by a code block for the response of each example.
  - Below the request/response examples, include code blocks for each potential error response, along with details on what causes the error and how it might be resolved.
- In some cases, it may be appropriate to group related methods together in a single `index.mdx` file. For example, the `index.mdx` file within the `task_init_trezor` folder contains documentation for all methods for initialisation and authentication with a Trezor hardware wallet.
- Where common structures exist in the request or response of mulitple methods, these should be documented in the `index.mdx` file in the base folder for a section (e.g. [src/pages/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/index.mdx](src/pages/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/index.mdx)), and linked to from request/response parameter tables where required.
- Where a method or parameter is deprecated, this should be communicated in the method heading or request parameters table.
- Separate sections of content with subheadings to make scanning and finding the information they need easier. Two line breaks should be used before and one line break after each subheading.

## General

- Use [American English spelling](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/American-English-vs-British-English-Spelling.htm)
- Use the [Oxford comma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUt7-B8IfxU)
- Use [Bluebook title case](https://titlecaseconverter.com/rules/#BB) for headings and products.
- Use [sentence case](https://titlecaseconverter.com/sentence-case/) for menu items, tabs, buttons, links, and all other text.
- Use a 4-space indent in code blocks for the request body and response. This will make the parameters and values easier to read.
- Use images or diagrams to help explain complex concepts or processes. This will make the content more engaging and easier to understand.
- If a user action requires a sequence of steps, consider using a flowchart to illustrate the process.
- Keep it concise: Stay on point. Avoid unnecessary words or phrases that do not add value to the content.
- Don't skimp on important detail: If a feature is complex, it's better to provide too much information than not enough. Where appropriate it may be better to split the additional information into its own page and add a link to it for those who want to dig deeper.
- Use simple language: Where possible, avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the reader. When unavoidable, provide a link to a definition or explanation of the term.
- Proofread and test your content: Make sure to proofread your MDX file for errors and test any code snippets or examples to ensure they work as expected.
- Be generous with hyperlinks: Link to relevant documentation or resources, whether to somewhere else within our internal docs or to a respected external source. This will provide additional context and help users better understand the content.
- Use absolute links for internal docs: The `pages` folder is the root directory for internal docs. Use absolute links to reference other pages within the `pages` folder, for example: `[Komodo DeFi Framework API methods](/komodo-defi-framework/api/#sub-section-header)`. The url must end with a slash.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists to break up long paragraphs to make the content more readable.

## Syntax

- Use `#` for page headings.
- Use `##` for subheadings.
- Use `###` for request/response parameter tables.
- Use `####` for request/response examples.
- Use mdx comments like this: `{/* comment comment */}` . Markdown comments like `<!--- comment comment--->` doesn't work. Alternatively, you can use the `<DevComment>` component tags.
- No markdown/mdx comments in tables' rows

## Tables

- Include a reference table listing all **request** parameters, their type, a description, and whether it is required or optional.
- Include a reference table listing all **response** parameters, their type, a description, and whether it is part of the standard response or only returned when using a specific request parameter value.
- Optional parameters should be listed at the bottom of the parameter table.
- Optional parameters should be identified at the start of the parameter's description, along with the default value (if applicable).
- Where specific parameters only apply for a specific action, this should be identified at the start of the parameter's description.
- Where a group of parameters are nested within a common structure, this should be given its own table, and linked to from the main parameter table.
- Common structure objects should be listed alphabetically in the file which contains them. This can be the same file as the parent method, unless the structure is used by multiple methods in different files - in that case, it should be listed in the root folder for the method group (e.g. legacy, v20, v20-dev).

For example:

| Parameter | Type    | Description                                                                                   |
| --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| coin      | string  | The name of the coin the user desires to activate.                                            |
| fee       | object  | Optional. A standard [FeeInfo](/komodo-defi-framework/api/common_structures/#FeeInfo) object. |
| amount    | float   | Required, unless `max` is `true`. The amount of balance to send.                              |
| max       | boolean | Optional, defaults to `false`. Send whole balance.                                            |
| memo      | string  | Optional, used for ZHTLC and Tendermint coins only. Attaches a memo to the transaction.       |

### CompactTable Component

For improved table layout and responsive design, use the `CompactTable` component instead of standard markdown tables when dealing with API parameters. The `CompactTable` component allows pulling table data from centralized JSON files and generating tables from the data. This ensures consistency and maintainability across the documentation.

#### How CompactTable Works

CompactTable uses a source attribute that references table data stored in JSON files:
- Table data is stored in `/src/data/tables/` directory
- Data is organized by subdirectory: `common-structures/`, `v2/`, etc.
- Each JSON file contains multiple table definitions
- Tables are referenced using the format: `directory/filename.tablename`

#### Import and Usage

The CompactTable component is globally imported. To use it with a source reference:
```jsx
<CompactTable source="common-structures/activation.ActivationMode" />
```

With variant option:
```jsx
<CompactTable source="v2/streaming.BalanceEnableRequestParameters" variant="compact" />
```

#### Source Reference Format

The `source` attribute follows this pattern:
- `directory/filename.tablename`
- Examples:
  - `common-structures/activation.ActivationMode`
  - `v2/utils.GetTokenInfoRequest`
  - `common-structures/wallet.BalanceInfo`

#### JSON Data Structure

Table data files are located in `/src/data/tables/` and follow this structure:

```json
{
  "TableName": {
    "title": "Table Title (optional)",
    "data": [
      {
        "parameter": "coin",
        "type": "string",
        "required": true,
        "description": "The name of the coin to activate. Can include [markdown links](/path/to/page/)."
      },
      {
        "parameter": "amount",
        "type": "float",
        "required": false,
        "default": "0",
        "description": "Optional. The amount to send."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### When to Use CompactTable

- **API documentation** with parameter tables
- **Common structures** used across multiple methods
- **Consistent data structures** that need central management
- **Tables with complex descriptions** including internal links

#### Variants

- **Default**: Standard table layout with all columns
- **`compact`**: Reduced spacing for dense pages with many tables
- **`minimal`**: Simplified layout for sidebars or quick reference

#### Benefits

- **Centralized data management**: Update table data in one place
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform table structure across docs
- **Validation**: JSON schema validation ensures data integrity
- **Link validation**: Internal links in descriptions are automatically validated
- **Reusability**: Same table data can be referenced from multiple pages

#### Migration from Standard Tables

**Before (problematic layout):**
```markdown
| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --------- | ---- | :------: | :-----: | ----------- |
| coin      | string |    ✓   |   `-`   | Name of coin |
```

**After (space-efficient):**
```jsx
<CompactTable data={[
  { parameter: "coin", type: "string", required: true, description: "Name of coin" }
]} />
```

#### Miscellanious

Also supports sending data directly, but not encouraged.

```jsx
<CompactTable 
  data={[
    {
      parameter: "coin",
      type: "string", 
      required: true,
      description: "The name of the coin the user desires to activate."
    },
    {
      parameter: "amount",
      type: "float",
      required: false,
      default: "false", 
      description: "The amount of balance to send."
    }
  ]}
/>
```

### KdfResponses Component

The `KdfResponses` component is used to display API responses for Komodo DeFi Framework methods. It automatically generates response examples from centralized JSON data files, ensuring consistency across documentation.

#### How KdfResponses Works

KdfResponses pulls response data from JSON files stored in `/src/data/responses/kdf/`:
- Response data is organized by subdirectory: `legacy/`, `v2/`, etc.
- Each JSON file contains multiple response definitions
- Responses are referenced using the `responseKey` attribute

#### Usage

The KdfResponses component is globally imported already. To use it:

```jsx
<KdfResponses responseKey="legacy/coin_activation.LegacyElectrumBch" />
```

#### Response Key Format

The `responseKey` attribute follows this pattern:
- `directory/filename.responsename`
- Examples:
  - `legacy/coin_activation.LegacyElectrumBch`
  - `legacy/coin_activation.LegacyEnableNative`
  - `v2/activation.EnableCoinResponse`

#### JSON Data Structure

Response data files are located in `/src/data/responses/kdf/` and follow this structure:

```json
{
  "ResponseName": {
    "type": "success",
    "title": "Response (successful activation)",
    "description": "Optional description of the response",
    "data": {
      "result": {
        "address": "RNacVDT8GwQ54CWe5PkEUemLz3WPapEXH9",
        "balance": "0",
        "coin": "KMD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### When to Use KdfResponses

- **API method responses**: Display standardized response examples
- **Success responses**: Show expected successful returns
- **Error responses**: Document potential error states
- **Multiple response variations**: Different responses based on request parameters

#### Benefits

- **Centralized response management**: Update responses in one place
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform response structure across docs
- **Validation**: JSON schema validation ensures data integrity
- **Reusability**: Same response data can be referenced from multiple pages
- **Automatic formatting**: Responses are automatically formatted as JSON code blocks

#### Best Practices

- Place `KdfResponses` immediately after the corresponding `CodeGroup` request example
- Use descriptive response names that match the method name
- Include both successful and error responses where applicable
- Group related responses in the same JSON file

## Variables

- For Komodo DeFi Framework API methods, the userpass variable should always be `RPC_UserP@SSW0RD`

## Templates

Use the linked templates below as a starting point for new documentation pages.

- [Komodo DeFi Framework API methods](templates/komodefi_method.mdx)

## How to contribute

Read the [Contribution guide](CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md) first.

Pages are heavily [**MDX**](https://mdxjs.com/) ("markdown extension") based, which allows us to use JSX in markdown content. You can have imported components (JSX) within your content and more. Read more about MDX here [https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/).

### Adding a Title and Description

Titles and descriptions are mandatory on every documentation page and must be added at the top level. To add a title use this syntax: `export const title = "Documentation page title";`. To add a description use: `export const description = "documentation page description";`

### Subsections and headings

Though it is good to separate each method into its own document, sometimes it is necessary to group methods together.
In such a case, we can define the `title`, `label` and/or `tag` properties alongside a section header and within a `CodeGroup` tag so that anchor links are generated in a consistent manner.

- The `label` property should be the exact same as the RPC method.
- The `title` property should be blank, unless the section heading is not the same as the `label` property. In that case, the `title` property should be the (human readable) section heading.
- for methods with a `task::xxxx::` or `lightning::xxxx::` prefix, the `label` property should be the full RPC method name, and the title should be the truncated RPC method without the prefix (only the last bit, after the last set of `::`), or a human readable title as above (recommended).

For example, with a human readable section heading:

```
## Transaction History
...
### my_tx_history with pagination {{label : 'my_tx_history', tag : 'POST'}}
<CodeGroup title="Transaction History" tag="POST" label="my_tx_history" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
...
</CodeGroup>
```

For example, with a `task::xxxx::` prefix:

```
# Trezor Initialisation
...
## init {{label : 'task::init_trezor::init', tag : 'POST'}}
...
<CodeGroup title="init" tag="POST" label="task::init_trezor::init" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
...
</CodeGroup>
```

For example, when method and title are the same:

```
## get_balance {{label : 'get_balance', tag : 'POST'}}
...
<CodeGroup title="" tag="POST" label="get_balance" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
...
</CodeGroup>
```

### Components

We've got a few **MDX** components we use across the Docs. Below is a walkthrough of how to start writing and using the components that make up the Docs.

IMPORTANT: Always use double quotes inside mdx tags.

Example:

Correct:

```
<CollapsibleSection expandedText="Hide Examples" collapsedText="Show Examples">
```

Wrong:

```
<CollapsibleSection expandedText='Hide Examples' collapsedText='Show Examples'>
```

MDX supports standard markdown by default [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/). However, this project also has [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) installed.

> Many of the components mentioned here are simplified and possibly do more than **explicitly pointed out**.

### CodeGroup

The `CodeGroup` acts as a wrapper around code blocks. It allows us to have tabbed content (or not, if it's a single block) with properties such as **title, tags, labels and more**. An example would look something like this:

````mdx
<CodeGroup title="Code Sample" tag="post" label="/kmd/jwt/post" >

```ts
// ...
```
````

```python

// ...

```

```php

// ...

```

</CodeGroup>
```

And rendered as:

![Code group UI](style-guide-images/code-group-sample.png)

<!-- If you have a single block of code, you can use the `CodeGroup` without wrapping it around the block by using `mdx-annotations`.

```mdx
```ts {{title: "Single Block", tag: "post", label: "/kmd/jwt/post"}}
// ...
```
```

And you'll still have it rendered correctly:

![Single code block UI](style-guide-images/single-code-block.png) -->

It is important to **note that**, "**Komodo DeFi Framework methods**" should be wrapped with `CodeGroup` tags, using the **method name** as the **label value**, and the **tag value** set to **POST**, an additional **mm2MethodDecorate property** with the value **"true"**. This will generate code blocks for:

- **JSON**: The pure request body.
- **Python3**: Using the requests library.
- **Bash**: Using curl.
- **Javascript**: using fetch.
- **PHP**: Using curl.
- **GO**: Using net/http. (need to confirm this is correct)
- **Ruby**: Using net/http.

You only need to include the `json` data, and the additional **mm2MethodDecorate property** populates for various languages automatically.

A working code sample would look like this:

````mdx
<CodeGroup title="Generate Invoice" tag="POST" label="generate_invoice" mm2MethodDecorate="true">

```json
{
  "userpass": "RPC_UserP@SSW0RD",
  "mmrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "lightning::payments::generate_invoice",
  "params": {
    "coin": "tBTC-TEST-lightning",
    "description": "test invoice"
  },
  "id": 56
}
```
````

</CodeGroup>
```

Rendered as:

![mm2MethodDecoratorUI](style-guide-images/mm2MethodDecoratorUI.png)

### Note

Use `Note` tags to **highlight important information**. `Note`s can be one of three states:

- **info** (Default)
- **warning**
- **error**

```mdx
<Note type="info">
  Komodo Platform is an open-source, decentralized blockchain project committed
  to privacy and security. It offers flexibility for developers with support for
  multiple programming languages and a modular architecture.
</Note>
```

```mdx
<Note type="warning">
  Komodo Platform is an open-source, decentralized blockchain project committed
  to privacy and security. It offers flexibility for developers with support for
  multiple programming languages and a modular architecture.
</Note>
```

```mdx
<Note type="error">
  Komodo Platform is an open-source, decentralized blockchain project committed
  to privacy and security. It offers flexibility for developers with support for
  multiple programming languages and a modular architecture.
</Note>
```

Rendered as:

![Note-info](style-guide-images/notes-info-UI.png)

![Note-warning](style-guide-images/notes-warning-UI.png)

![Note-error](style-guide-images/notes-error-UI.png)

### CollapsibleSection

This renders a button with a specified text based on its state (expanded or collapsed).

You'll mostly use this for API, Commands, etc. Responses, which should be wrapped with the `CollapsibleSection` tags, for example:

````mdx
#### Response (ready, successful)

<CollapsibleSection expandedText='Hide Response' collapsedText='Show Response'>

    ```json
    {
       "mmrpc": "2.0",
       "result": "success",
       "id": null
    }
    ```

</CollapsibleSection>
````

The `CollapsibleSection` tags should also wrap all error responses (as a group), with the `expandedText` and `collapsedText` values set to '**Show Error Responses**' and '**Hide Error Responses' respectively**.

Headers like `#### Response (ready, successful)` should be outside the `CollapsibleSection` tags

A working code would look like this:

````mdx
<CollapsibleSection expandedText='Hide code' collapsedText='Show code'>

```json
{
  "sad_story": "What did the robot say to the dead robot? Rust-in-peace",
  "category": "programming",
  "rating": 8.5,
  "source": "unknown",
  "date": "2078-05-16"
}
```

</CollapsibleSection>
````

Rendered as:

![collapsible Section UI](style-guide-images/collapsible-section-UI.png)

### Images

Images should be added to the related subfolder within the `src/images` folder, and rendered using the `OptimizedImage` component. To render an image in the `src/image` folder, you'd have to import the image using the following syntax:

```jsx
import komodefiManiq from "@/public/images/docs/komodefi-maniq.webp";
```

Now you can render the image using the `OptimizedImage` component, for example:

```jsx
<OptimizedImage title="Komodo DeFi Framework" src={komodefiManiq} alt="Komodo DeFi Framework" classNaming="w-full" />
```

![Komodo DeFi Framework](style-guide-images/komodefi-maniq.png)

<!-- [You can read more about the magic behind OptimizedImage](https://github.com/Niels-IO/next-image-export-optimizer#readme) -->

### Heading

The `Heading` component (defaults to `h2`) functions exactly like the **native heading** tags with the exception that it takes a prop that allows us to have it labelled and tagged. It also takes an `anchor` prop (defaults to `true`) that makes it possible to link that section to another section on the page by passing it an `id` prop. If `anchor = true` and no `id` is passed, it links to itself.

To use this component, you need to have it imported: `import { Heading } from "@/components/mdx/Heading";`

Then render it:

```mdx
<Heading label="get_all_tokens" tag="API-v2" anchor={false}>
  How to get your tokens
</Heading>
```

To save time, you can use the `Heading` component without importing it. And this can be done by using the native **heading tag** but **with annotations** matching the props you'd otherwise pass to the `Heading` component. Depending on the `props`, this renders the same output in the browser.

Here's how:

```mdx
## How to get your tokens {{label : 'get_all_tokens', tag : 'API-v2'}}
```

Rendered as:

![heading tag UI](style-guide-images/heading-tag-UI.png)

### TaggedSection

`TaggedSection`s are used to **tag && label** a section. Just like the `Heading` component. The heading component uses the `TaggedSection` component under the hood.

To use this component, you need to have it imported: `import { TaggedSection } from "@/components/mdx/Heading";`

However, it is often used for tagging/labelling headings (`h2 || h1`). If you happen to find a use for it in a non-heading section, feel free to use it.

Here's how to use it:

```mdx
<TaggedSection tag={"Post"} label={"kmd/token/token_id"} />
```

Rendered as:

![Tagged section](style-guide-images/tagged-section-UI.png)

### Tag

`Tag`s are used for tagging a `CRUD` operation. To use it, import it with the syntax `import { Tag } from "@/components/mdx/Tag";`.
This component takes 4 types of children as follows

- C - **post**
- R - **get**
- U - **put**
- D - **delete**

A working code would look like this:

```
<Tag>post</Tag>
<Tag>get</Tag>
<Tag>put</Tag>
<Tag>delete</Tag>
```

Rendered as:

![Tag component](style-guide-images/crude-tag-ui.png)

## ToCForIndex

This component can be included in the root index.mdx files in any of the directories that hold a specific category of docs. This component will populate a list with the table of contents for the section.

Rendered as:

![TocForIndex component](style-guide-images/toc-for-index.png)

## Navbar (Top)

Top navbar's navigation data/dropdown list is manually populated. This file can be found at [src/data/navbar.json](src/data/navbar.json). If you're working on a very important new page, which links to a whole new category or an index, this is where to add them.

![Navbar top](style-guide-images/navbar-top-UI.png)

## Sidebar (Left)

Left sidebar's navigation data is manually populated. This file can be found at [src/data/sidebar.json](src/data/sidebar.json). If you're working on a new page, this is where to link them.

Along with `titleLink`, an empty links array is expected:

```json
"titleLink": "/qa/komodefi-api-quickstart/",
"links": []
```

![Sidebar left](style-guide-images/sidebar-left-UI.png)

## Sidebar (Right)

![Sidebar right](style-guide-images/sidebar-right-UI.png)

The right sidebar is automatically populated based on the **Heading hierarchy** of the current page.

## Conclusion

As much as we can, we try to make every file as readable as possible, so you won't be needing help figuring out **how to do/use {A || B}**.
We encourage you to do the same when you're contributing and you just might get a medal of binary from the community.

Thats it! You've completed the KMD-Docs contribution boot camp!

Have fun!
