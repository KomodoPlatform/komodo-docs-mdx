    summary: Remove Delegation
    description: |
      The remove_delegation method stops your node's staking of a compatible coin.
      Currently QTUM and tQTUM have been integrated, but this functionality will be expanded to more coins in future.
      Note: After running remove_delegation, you will need to broadcast the returned hex via send_raw_transaction to complete the process.
