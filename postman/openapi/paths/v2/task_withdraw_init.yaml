    summary: Initialize Withdraw Task
    description: |
      The task::withdraw::init method generates, signs, and returns a transaction that transfers the amount of coin to the address indicated in the to argument.
      The status of this method can be queried via the task::withdraw::status method.
      It will return the transaction hex (via task::withdraw::status), which then needs to be broadcast to complete the withdrawal.
      When used for ZHTLC coins like ARRR or ZOMBIE, it may take some time to complete.
