    summary: Add Delegation
    description: |
      The add_delegation method initiates your node's staking of a compatible coin.
      Currently QTUM and tQTUM have been integrated, but this functionality will be expanded to more coins in future.
      Note: Only UTXOs of 100 QTUM / tQTUM will be actively staked. After running add_delegation, you will need to broadcast the returned hex via send_raw_transaction to complete the process.
