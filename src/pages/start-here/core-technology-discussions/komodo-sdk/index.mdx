# Komodo SDK

Komodo SDK is an all-in-one solution for building, deploying, and managing blockchain and DeFi (d)applications. It includes the Komodo DeFi Framework, Komodo Core Protocol and the Komodo GUI/DAPP Suite, which make up a complete set of tools, APIs, and libraries to help you create your own blockchain-based products.

All these tools empower developers, businesses, and end-users alike.
