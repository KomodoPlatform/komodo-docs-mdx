# Komodo API Documentation

Komodo's blockchain technology enables developers to create fully independent blockchains in a secure and highly competitive environment.

Each independent blockchain built on the Komodo framework has a wide range of capabilities, including:

- Bitcoin-hash rate supported security

- Enterprise-level scalability

- Consensus customization

- Blockchain clustering

- ...and more!

Because a Komodo-based blockchain is independently managed, the developer has complete freedom, so long as the essential connections to the Komodo ecosystem remain.
