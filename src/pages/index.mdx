In addition to the above, Komodo's blockchain technology enables developers to create fully independent blockchains in a secure and highly composable environment.

Each independent blockchain built using Komodo has a wide range of capabilities, including:

*   Litecoin-hash rate supported security

*   Enterprise-level scalability

*   Consensus customization

*   Blockchain clustering

*   ...and more!

Because a Komodo-based blockchain is independently managed, the developer has complete freedom, so long as the essential connections to the Komodo ecosystem remain.
