# Komodo API Documentation

Komodo's blockchain technology enables developers to create fully independent blockchains in a secure and highly competitive environment.

Each independent blockchain built on the Komodo framework has a wide range of capabilities, including:

*   Bitcoin-hash rate supported security

*   Enterprise-level scalability

*   Consensus customization

*   Blockchain clustering

*   ...and more!

Because a Komodo-based blockchain is independently managed, the developer has complete freedom, so long as the essential connections to the Komodo ecosystem remain.
