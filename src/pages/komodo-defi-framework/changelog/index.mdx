## Komodo DeFi Framework v2.1.0-beta

### Essential New Features: Trading Protocol Upgrade, HD Wallet, Event Streaming, and Seeds Management

This release introduces a range of significant features designed to enhance the frameworkâ€™s capabilities. The trading protocol has been upgraded to boost the security and reliability of swaps. HD Wallets have been integrated to enhance privacy and streamline address management for both UTXO and EVM chains. Event Streaming has been implemented to provide clients with real-time balance updates, with more real-time events planned for future updates. Seed Management has been enhanced to ensure robust seed generation and storage. These features are complemented by advancements in the NFT feature, expanded chain support for Trezor, fee improvements, ARRR/Pirate support in browser environments, and updates to the Tendermint protocol that facilitate integration with external wallets.

### Release Notes

#### Features:

*   **Trading Protocol Upgrade:**

    *   A major upgrade to the trading protocol (enabled with `"use_trading_proto_v2": true`) was implemented by @artemii235 in several PRs. This upgrade is currently available only for UTXO/UTXO swaps. All other swap types are not yet supported with this new protocol.

    *   This upgrade introduces significant enhancements:

        *   Immediate refund handling for taker payments, including DEX fee refunds, and subsequent immediate maker payment refunds, effectively solving maker/taker backout issues.
        *   New RPCs: `my_swap_status`, `my_recent_swaps`, and `active_swaps` V2.
        *   Upgraded swap data is also accessible through V1 RPCs.
        *   *Important note:* Seednodes must be updated to support and rebroadcast new swap protocol messages.

    *   **Relevant PRs:** [#1927](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1927), [#1958](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1958), [#1980](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1980), [#2015](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2015), [#2046](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2046).

*   **HD Wallet:**

    *   HD wallet functionalities were fully implemented by @shamardy for UTXO and EVM coins, allowing users to enable the feature with `"enable_hd": true`. For Tendermint and Pirate coins, only a single address is supported, following the BIP32/39/44 standards.

    *   This implementation simplifies the process of importing mnemonics from other wallets into the Komodo DeFi Framework (KDF), enabling users to retain their balances, transaction history, and more.

    *   Users can now manage multiple addresses for UTXO and EVM coins, enhancing flexibility and control. The `path_to_address` parameter was added to coin activation requests to set the default account'/change/address\_index path used for swaps. If not provided, the default path will be 0'/0/0.

    *   HD withdrawals from any account'/change/address\_index path were added for UTXO, EVM, Tendermint, and ARRR coins.

    *   Address scanning for balances is supported through the `scan_for_new_addresses` RPC, and users can manage their HD wallet with new RPCs such as `account_balance`, `get_new_address`, and `create_new_account`.

    *   These RPCs (`scan_for_new_addresses`, `account_balance`, `get_new_address`, and `create_new_account`) can be managed through the task manager using `task::<rpc-name>::(init, cancel, status)`.

    *   For full HD wallet functionalities, including balance scanning and withdrawals, use task manager-enabled methods like `task::enable_eth::init`, `task::enable_qtum::init`, `task::enable_utxo::init`, `task::enable_erc20::init`, and manage tasks through `task::<rpc-name>::(init, cancel, status)`.

    *   Task manager withdrawals are also supported using `task::withdraw::init`.

    *   **Relevant PRs:** [#1933](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1933), [#1962](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1962).

*   **Event Streaming:**

    *   Streaming channels using Server-Sent Events (SSE) to continuously send data to clients were implemented by @onur-ozkan in several PRs. This feature supports various event types, including P2P network events, coin balance events, error events, and heartbeat events.

    *   **P2P network events**: Streaming real-time updates about the network status.

    *   **Coin balance events**: For UTXOs, EVM, ARRR/Pirate by @borngraced, and Tendermint Protocols, providing continuous balance updates.

    *   **Error events**: Emitted when there's an error in generating an event, ensuring robust monitoring.

    *   **Heartbeat events**: Periodic notifications about the health of the streaming channel.

    *   For WebAssembly (Wasm), event streaming uses Shared Workers instead of SSE, enabling a more flexible and efficient event handling mechanism.
        *   SharedWorker support was added, allowing any worker path in `event_stream_configuration`, with a default to `event_streaming_worker.js`.
        *   To handle broadcasted messages from the client side, an event listener must be implemented within the client browser environment to capture and process these events as they are streamed.

    *   To utilize this feature, the `event_stream_configuration` needs to be added to the KDF config before starting.

    *   **Relevant PRs:** [#1945](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1945), [#1978](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1978), [#2013](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2013), [#2041](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2041), [#2058](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2058), [#2076](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2076), [#2080](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2080).

*   **Seed Management:**

    *   Seed generation, encryption, and storage were implemented by @shamardy, introducing secure methods for seed handling, including strong encryption and key derivation techniques.

    *   Introduced a new `get_mnemonic` API for retrieving mnemonics as plaintext or encrypted.

    *   Added support for a `wallet_name` parameter in the configuration, enabling KDF to handle seed management.
        *   If `wallet_name` is used, `wallet_password` must be provided, allowing for encrypted storage and retrieval of mnemonics.
        *   If no mnemonic is provided, a new one is generated, encrypted, and stored.
        *   Existing mnemonics can be imported and encrypted, or mnemonics can be imported in an encrypted format.

    *   Introduced a global database for storing encrypted mnemonics and wallet names, separate from individual wallet-specific databases.

    *   Seed management is fully integrated within KDF when `wallet_name` config parameter is used, bypassing the need for external mnemonic handling.

    *   **Relevant PRs:** [#2014](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2014), [#1939](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/issues/1939).

### NB - Backwards compatibility breaking changes

*   The `mm2` binaries have been renamed to `kdf`, with backward-compatible copies provided for `mm2` naming. However, WASM binaries use the `kdf` naming only, which is a breaking change. [#2126](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2126) by @shamardy

## Komodo DeFi Framework v2.0.0-beta

### Network Evolution & KMD Burn: Enhancing KMD's Role in Komodo's DeFi Framework

Introducing pivotal network enhancements to pave the way for an evolved DEX P2P network, Komodo DeFi Framework 2.0.0-beta marks a strategic step forward. This release not only streamlines network performance but also introduces a deflationary aspect to KMD, underscoring its utility and value in Komodo Platform's expanding ecosystem.

### Release Notes

**Features:**

*   KMD Burn:
    *   Burning 25% of the taker fee when paid in KMD was implemented by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#2006](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2006)
*   Swap watcher nodes (only for UTXO/UTXO swaps):
    *   For UTXO/UTXO swaps, watcher nodes will either complete the swap for taker or refund the taker payment if the taker goes offline after sending their payment. This was implemented by [@caglaryucekaya](https://github.com/caglaryucekaya) in [#1457](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1457) [#1496](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1496) [#1523](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1523) [#1552](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1552)
    *   Using watcher nodes for swaps were enabled by default for UTXO/UTXO swaps by [@caglaryucekaya](https://github.com/caglaryucekaya). All nodes doing a swap will broadcast a watcher message after the taker payment is sent if both coins swapped are supported by watchers (currently only UTXO) [#1859](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1859)

**Enhancements:**

*   Network Enhancements:
    *   P2P layer was upgraded to use the latest stable libp2p version by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#1878](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1878)
    *   `7777` network was deprecated by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#2020](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2020).
    *   Seednodes for `netid` `8762` were updated by [@smk762](https://github.com/smk762) [#2024](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2024)
    *   `libp2p-yamux` was updated by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) to use yamux `v0.13` (new version) by default and to fall back to yamux `v0.12` (old version) when setting any configuration options [#2030](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2030)
    *   The backpressure buffer cap was increased from `25` to `256` by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#2030](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2030)
    *   New protocol version (Version2) was added by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) to be used for peer exchange and request-response behaviours in [#2030](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2030)
    *   Network information is now written to stdout so users can find mm2 ports easily [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#2034](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2034)
*   NFT feature was released in [v1.0.6-beta](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/releases/tag/v1.0.6-beta), this release adds significant enhancements to this feature:
    *   `exclude_spam` and `exclude_phishing` params were added for `get_nft_list` and `get_nft_transfers` RPCs by [@laruh](https://github.com/laruh) [#1959](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1959)
    *   Spam transfers with empty meta was fixed by [@laruh](https://github.com/laruh) to no longer update [#1989](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1989)
*   `version` method was added to `PUBLIC_METHODS` that require no login by [@smk762](https://github.com/smk762) [#2001](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2001)
*   An additional `PRICE_ENDPOINTS` url which is a cached copy of `https://prices.komodian.info/api/v2/tickers` and is updated every minute was added by [@smk762](https://github.com/smk762) [#2032](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2032)

**Bug Fixes:**

*   ARRR/Pirate:
    *   ARRR infrastructure for lightwallet servers uses a fork of `lightwalletd`, the grpc service was renamed by [@smk762](https://github.com/smk762) `from cash.z.wallet.sdk.rpc` to `pirate.wallet.sdk.rpc` to use the `lightwalletd` fork [#1963](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1963)
    *   Previous blocks/wallet sync was fixed by [@borngraced](https://github.com/borngraced) to be resumed if `sync_params` are not provided after restart [#1967](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/issues/1967)
*   EVM web3 requests timeout was reduced to 20s by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1973](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1973)
*   Fixed `0.0001` min threshold for TakerFee was removed by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1971](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1971)
*   The minimum trading volume for evm and tendermint was changed to be the smallest possible amount of the coin by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1971](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1971)
*   Minimum trading price was reduced by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) to be any value above 0 [#1971](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1971)
*   `Cryptocondition` script type was added to utxo transactions by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1991](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1991)
*   On response error the next web3 node is now tried [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1998](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1998)
*   Watchtower taker-side restart bug was fixed by [@caglaryucekaya](https://github.com/caglaryucekaya) [#1908](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1908)
*   `rpcport` value can now accept a string [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#2026](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2026)

### NB - Backwards compatibility breaking changes

*   `7777` Network deprecation and the upgrade to a new p2p layer breaks compatibility with previous versions of Komodo DeFi Framework. Connections between nodes/clients running an older version of Komodo DeFi Framework and nodes/clients running this version will not be possible. To avoid this, all nodes/clients must be upgraded to the latest version of Komodo DeFi Framework.
*   Because of KMD burn of a part of the taker fee, the taker fee outputs for any `coin/KMD` swap are changed and makers running older versions will not be able to validate the taker fee, this will cause the swap to fail. This case will never happen anyway because older versions will not be able to connect to this latest version due to the network upgrade.
*   Because of the removal of the fixed 0.0001 min threshold for TakerFee, taker fee validation will also fail for these cases. Again, this case will never happen as the previous case.

## Komodo DeFi Framework v1.0.7-beta

**Enhancements:**

*   Using a specific start date for Pirate/ARRR synchronization was added by [@borngraced](https://github.com/borngraced). This allows users to specify a specific date as the starting point for synchronization as a substitute for the checkpoint block from config or syncing from the first block [#1922](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1922)

**Bug Fixes:**

*   PoSV coins withdrawal was fixed by [@reddink](https://github.com/reddink). The issue was a missing n\_time field in the generated transaction. The fix now correctly considers when n\_time is required, and the rawtransaction can be broadcasted [#1925](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1925)
*   Tendermint tests were fixed by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) by using latest relayer channel [#1929](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1929)
*   Price service urls were updated by [@smk762](https://github.com/smk762) [#1928](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1928)
*   NFT transactions that transfer multiple NFT tokens were fixed in db by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy). log\_index is now used as part of the transfers history table primary key [#1926](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1926)
*   A fix was introduced by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) to use kmd rewards for fees if change + interest is below dust threshold [#1944](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1944)
*   Debug info was removed from release binary by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) to reduce the file size [#1954](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1954)
*   Failing tests due to BCHD were ignored by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1955](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1955)
