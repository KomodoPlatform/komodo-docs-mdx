# Using Komodo DeFi Framework CLI in Console

For convenience, the  standalone `komodefi-cli` binary is provided to be used for interacting with the Komodo DeFi Framework network from the command line.

## Building Komodo DeFi Framework CLI

Refer to [https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework?tab=readme-ov-file#building-from-source](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework?tab=readme-ov-file#building-from-source) for instructions on installing dependencies and preparing your build environment.

Once it is ready, you can build the komodefi-cli binary by running the following command from the root folder of the project repository:

```bash
cargo build --manifest-path ./mm2src/komodefi_cli/Cargo.toml --out-dir $(pwd)/bin -Z unstable-options
```

We also add the `bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable so that the `komodefi-cli` binary can be executed from any location.

```bash
export PATH=${PATH}:$(pwd)/bin
```

## Configuration

#### Setting Default CLI Root Path

You can customize the default root directory for `komodefi-cli` by setting the `KOMODEFI_CLI_ROOT` environment variable. This allows you to specify a location for saving configuration files, binaries, and other related data.

```bash
export KOMODEFI_CLI_ROOT=$HOME/komodefi-cli
```

#### Downloading the Core API binary

Before using the `komodefi-cli` binary, you need to download the Core API binary. Running the following command to download the latest release:

```bash
komodefi-cli mm2 download
```

#### Configuring the Core API

For the `komodefi-cli` to work, you need to configure the Core API by setting the `coins` data and the information required for an [MM2.json](/komodo-defi-framework/tutorials/api-walkthrough/#launching-the-komodo-de-fi-framework-api) file. For more information, run the following command:

```bash
komodefi-cli init --help
```

Which will return

```bash
Config is not set
Initialize a predefined coin set and configuration to start mm2 instance with

Usage: komodefi-cli init [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --mm-coins-path <MM_COINS_PATH>  Coin set file path [default: coins] [aliases: coins]
      --mm-conf-path <MM_CONF_PATH>    mm2 configuration file path [default: MM2.json] [aliases: conf]
  -h, --help                           Print help
```

If you have an existing coins file and/or MM2.json file, you can use the `--mm-coins-path` and `--mm-conf-path` options to specify the file paths, as below.

```bash
komodefi-cli init --mm-coins-path /path/to/coins --mm-conf-path /path/to/MM2.json
```

Alternatively, run `komodefi-cli init` without any options to create the `coins` and `MM2.json` files interactively. Pressing enter for each option will use the default values. In the case of the mnemonic phrase, you can enter your own mnemonic phrase or press enter to use a newly generated one.

```bash
$ komodefi-cli init 
    Config is not set
    Start collecting mm2_cfg into: /home/smk762/komodefi-cli/MM2.json
    > gui is set by default: komodefi-cli
    > What is the network `mm2` is going to be a part, netid: 8762
    > What is the seed phrase: before device quantum scan agent gift sauce flame devote tiny ripple west
    > Allow weak password: No
    > What is the rpc_password: <tb+UD32
    > What is dbdir None
    > Use secure connection for rpc: No
    > What is rpcip: None
    > What is the rpcport: 7783
    > What is rpc_local_only: 
    > What is i_am_seed: 
    Reading seed nodes until tap enter is met
    > What is the next seednode: None
    > What is enable_hd: 
    mm2_cfg has been writen into: /home/smk762/komodefi-cli/MM2.json

    Download activation_scheme from: https://stats.kmd.io/api/table/coin_activation/
    Initialization done
```

#### Starting the Core API

After the configuration is set, you can start the Core API by running `komodefi-cli mm2 start`. You can also use the `--help` option to see the available options for this command:

```bash
komodefi-cli mm2 start -help  
Start mm2 instance  
  
Usage: komodefi-cli mm2 start [OPTIONS]  
  
Options:  
     --mm-conf-path <MM_CONF_PATH>    mm2 configuration file path [aliases: conf]  
     --mm-coins-path <MM_COINS_PATH>  Coin set file path [aliases: coins]  
     --mm-log <MM_LOG>                Log file path [aliases: log]  
 -h, --help                           Print help
```

For example, to start the Core API and save its runtime logs to \~/logs/mm2.log, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ komodefi-cli mm2 start --mm-log ~/logs/mm2.log  
> Set env MM_LOG as: ~/logs/mm2.log  
> Started child process: "mm2", pid: 459264
```

From here, you are ready to use the `komodefi-cli` binary to interact with the Komodo DeFi Framework network. You can use the `--help` option to see the available commands and options.

```bash
komodefi-cli --help
