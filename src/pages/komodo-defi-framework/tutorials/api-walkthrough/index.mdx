# Komodo DeFi Framework API Walkthrough

Now that you have the Komodo DeFi Framework API [installed](/komodo-defi-framework/setup/) you are ready for your first atomic swap!
Since we're testing Komodo DeFi Framework API as a back end, we're going to be doing a few things that a normal user using a GUI will not be expected to do.
Let's open up the terminal and get started.

## Setting Up the Coin List

In the Komodo ecosystem we use two blockchain coins, DOC and MARTY, for testing purposes. These coins are freely distributed and have no blockchain scarcity, so don't treat these coins as having any real value.
If you lose them or destroy them, there's no need to stress. You can always grab more from our faucet in the [KomodoPlatform Discord server](https://komodoplatform.com/discord).
Let's set up a file in the `~/komodo-defi-framework/target/debug` directory to import the settings for these test coins. Make a file called `coins` and place the following text into it:

```json
[
  {
    "coin": "DOC",
    "asset": "DOC",
    "fname": "DOC",
    "rpcport": 62415,
    "txversion": 4,
    "overwintered": 1,
    "mm2": 1,
    "sign_message_prefix": "Komodo Signed Message:\n",
    "is_testnet": true,
    "required_confirmations": 1,
    "requires_notarization": false,
    "avg_blocktime": 60,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "UTXO"
    },
    "derivation_path": "m/44'/141'",
    "trezor_coin": "Komodo"
  },
  {
    "coin": "MARTY",
    "asset": "MARTY",
    "fname": "MARTY",
    "rpcport": 52592,
    "txversion": 4,
    "overwintered": 1,
    "mm2": 1,
    "sign_message_prefix": "Komodo Signed Message:\n",
    "is_testnet": true,
    "required_confirmations": 1,
    "requires_notarization": false,
    "avg_blocktime": 60,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "UTXO"
    },
    "derivation_path": "m/44'/141'",
    "trezor_coin": "Komodo"
  }
]
```

Save this file. Komodo DeFi Framework API will search for it automatically on launch.

<Note>
  The `coins` file in [this linked repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins) contains the standard coin configuration file used in GUI software.
  You can download and use [this file](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins) if you want to activate other coins.

  Servers used for light mode activation are listed within [this file](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/utils/coins_config.json),
  and you can find many coin activation request body json examples at [https://stats.kmd.io/atomicdex/activation\_commands/](https://stats.kmd.io/atomicdex/activation_commands/).
</Note>

## Launching the Komodo DeFi Framework API

We also need to create an MM2.json file in the same directory as the `coins` file. We'll use a minimal configuration for this example (check out the [configure KDF guide](/komodo-defi-framework/setup/configure-mm2-json/) for more information about additional configuration parameters).

### MM2.json Minimal Configuration

| Parameter     | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gui           | string          | Information to identify which app, tool or product is using the API, e.g. `KomodoWallet iOS 1.0.1`. Helps developers identify if an issue is related to specific builds or operating systems etc. |
| netid         | integer         | Nework ID number, telling the Komodo DeFi Framework API which network to join. At least one seed node domain or IP address needs to be specified on the same `netid` to support it.               |
| seednodes     | list of strings | The domain or IP address of at least one seed node running on the same `netid` is required for peer discovery, orderbook propagation and transmitting swap events.                                |
| passphrase    | string          | Your passphrase; this is the source of each of your coins private keys. KEEP IT SAFE!                                                                                                             |
| rpc\_password | string          | For RPC requests that need authentication, this will need to match the `userpass` value in the request body.                                                                                      |

<Note>
  Unless you include the `allow_weak_password` paramater and set it to `true`, your `rpc_password`:

  *   Can't have 3 of the same characters in a row,
  *   Must be between 8-32 characters in length
  *   Must contain at least one each of the following: numeric, uppercase, lowercase, special character (e.g. !#$\*).
  *   Must not contain the word "password", or the chars `<`, `>`, or `&`.
</Note>

The MM2.json configuration commands can also be supplied at runtime, as below:

```bash
stdbuf -oL ./kdf "{\"gui\":\"Docs_Walkthru\",\"netid\":8762, "seednodes": ["seed01.kmdefi.net", "seed02.kmdefi.net"], \"passphrase\":\"YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE\", \"rpc_password\":\"YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE\"}" &
```

Replace `YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE` and `YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE` with your actual passphrase and password, and then execute the command in the terminal.

You should see output similar to the following:

```

If you see something similar, the Komodo DeFi Framework API is up and running!

<Note classNaming="flex-col">
  When using the Komodo DeFi Framework API on a VPS without accompanying tools such as `tmux` or `screen`, it is recommended to use [`nohup`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nohup-command-in-linux). This will ensure that the Komodo DeFi Framework API instance is not shutdown when the user logs out.

  ```bash
  stdbuf -oL nohup ./kdf "{\"gui\":\"Docs_Walkthru\",\"netid\":8762, "seednodes": ["seed01.kmdefi.net", "seed02.kmdefi.net"]
  , \"passphrase\":\"YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE\", \"rpc_password\":\"YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE\"}" &
  ```
</Note>

### Setting `userpass` Environment Variable

Create a new file in the `~/komodo-defi-framework/target/debug` folder called `userpass`, then enter the following text using the same `rpc_password` as is in your MM2.json file or runtime configuration string:

```bash
export userpass="RPC_UserP@SSW0RD"
```

Save it, and then in the terminal execute:

```bash
source userpass
```

Test it by executing:

```bash
echo $userpass
```

You should now see your userpass printed to the console.

<Note>
  The `userpass` environment variable will remain in memory until the session is
  closed. When you open up a new session later, you'll need to create the
  `userpass` environment variable again. Additional environment variables for
  the Komodo DeFi Framework API can be found in the [configure KDF
  guide](/komodo-defi-framework/setup/configure-mm2-json/).
</Note>

### Connect to the Selected Coin Networks

While we did set up the `coins` file for wach coin's configuration properties earlier, the Komodo DeFi Framework API doesn't to connect to their blockchain networks until we send a [coin activation request](/komodo-defi-framework/api/legacy/coin_activation/).

To activate DOC and MARTY, send the following requests to the Komodo DeFi Framework API:

<CodeGroup title="" tag="POST" label="electrum" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
  ```json
  {
    "userpass": "RPC_UserP@SSW0RD",
    "method": "electrum",
    "coin": "MARTY",
    "servers": [
      {
        "url": "electrum1.cipig.net:10021"
      },
      {
        "url": "electrum2.cipig.net:10021"
      },
      {
        "url": "electrum3.cipig.net:10021"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CollapsibleSection expandedText="Hide Response" collapsedText="Show Response">
  ```json
  {
    "address": "RLgAgBFHFbG2ma9MDTHyKL5vovftMepBkE",
    "coin": "MARTY",
    "balance": 16.95595733,
    "result": "success"
  }
  ```
</CollapsibleSection>

You are now connected to the MARTY test-blockchain network!

Let's connect to DOC (note it uses a different Electrum port).

<CodeGroup title="" tag="POST" label="electrum" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
  ```json
  {
    "userpass": "RPC_UserP@SSW0RD",
    "method": "electrum",
    "coin": "DOC",
    "servers": [
      {
        "url": "electrum1.cipig.net:10020"
      },
      {
        "url": "electrum2.cipig.net:10020"
      },
      {
        "url": "electrum3.cipig.net:10020"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CollapsibleSection expandedText="Hide Response" collapsedText="Show Response">
  ```json
  {"address": "RLgAgBFHFbG2ma9MDTHyKL5vovftMepBkE","coin": "DOC","balance": 11.27710708,"result": "success"}
  ```
</CollapsibleSection>

You are now connected to the DOC test-blockchain network!

### Get MARTY from the Faucet

Note that in the examples the address, `RLgAgBFHFbG2ma9MDTHyKL5vovftMepBkE`, is present in both returned responses. You will see a different address in your returned responses - your address is unique to to your `passphrase`.

To get free DOC and MARTY coins, use the Flux-Bot faucet in the [KomodoPlatform Discord](https://komodoplatform.com/discord) with the slash command below:

```bash
/faucet-drip MARTY RLgAgBFHFbG2ma9MDTHyKL5vovftMepBkE
```

In a minute or so a few MARTY coins will arrive in your address. You can [check your balance](/komodo-defi-framework/api/legacy/my_balance/) with the request below:

<CodeGroup title="" tag="POST" label="my_balance" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
  ```json
  {
    "userpass": "RPC_UserP@SSW0RD",
    "method": "my_balance",
    "coin": "MARTY"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CollapsibleSection expandedText="Hide Response" collapsedText="Show Response">
  ```json
  {"address": "RQNUR7qLgPUgZxYbvU9x5Kw93f6LU898CQ","balance": 77.7,"coin": "MARTY"}
  ```
</CollapsibleSection>

Now you are ready to trade!

### The Komodo DeFi Framework Orderbook

Komodo DeFi Framework uses a decentralized, peer-to-peer orderbook empowering users to trade without having to rely on a centralized service.

This avoids some serious problems which can affect centralized exchanges, such as:

*   Security risks: There's always a chance [hackers](https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/), [founders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20BEJouWBgY) or other [bad actors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P14nZqx2ZdY) could steal a users assets or [personal information](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/crypto-exchange-coinsquare-suffers-from-user-data-breach) because everything is stored on the exchange's servers.
*   Lack of transparency: It's difficult to know if the exchange is playing fair, which can lead to [market manipulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRXdxiot5JM) or insider trading.
*   Limited user control: Users don't have complete control over their funds, as they are held by the exchange. Remember: [**Not your keys, not your coins!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnC5mFaIW3Q)
*   Limited asset offerings: Centralized exchanges may not have as diverse a range of cryptocurrencies available for trading.
*   High exit fees: Users might have to pay a lot of money just to withdraw their funds. If some cases, [withdrawals are suspended](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LFOCppNHnds) altogether!

To see the orders listed on the Komodo DeFi Framework orderbook, use the [`orderbook`](/komodo-defi-framework/api/legacy/orderbook/) method:

<CodeGroup title="" tag="POST" label="orderbook" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
  ```json
  {
    "userpass": "RPC_UserP@SSW0RD",
    "method": "orderbook",
    "base": "DOC",
    "rel": "MARTY"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The response below shows a list of users willing to send DOC in exchange for MARTY.

<CollapsibleSection expandedText="Hide Response" collapsedText="Show Response">

  ```
</CollapsibleSection>

<Note>
  Notice that the output is not easily readable in the terminal. This is where
  we start using `jq`. You may remember that we installed software called `jq`
  during the setup process. `jq` is optional, but it is recommended as it makes
  reading the output in the terminal easier. To use `jq`, simply add the
  following to the end of any command: `| jq`.
</Note>

Try again this time adding ` | jq` to the end of the `bash` example below:

<CodeGroup title="" tag="POST" label="orderbook" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
  ```json
  {
    "userpass": "RPC_UserP@SSW0RD",
    "method": "orderbook",

  }
  ```
</CollapsibleSection>

That's much easier to read. We can easily see someone with the address `RJTYiYeJ8eVvJ53n2YbrVmxWNNMVZjDGLh` is willing to swap DOC for MARTY.

```bash
"base": "DOC",
"rel": "MARTY",
```

They are asking `2` MARTY for every `1` DOC and have a total of `10855.85028615` available to trade.

```bash
"price": 2,
"maxvolume": 10855.85028615,
```

### Initiate a Swap

Let's create a DOC/MARTY [`buy`](/komodo-defi-framework/api/legacy/buy/) order

<CodeGroup title="" tag="POST" label="buy" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
  ```json
  {
    "userpass": "RPC_UserP@SSW0RD",
    "method": "buy",
    "base": "DOC",
    "rel": "MARTY",
    "volume": "1",
    "price": "2"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CollapsibleSection expandedText="Hide Response" collapsedText="Show Response">
  ```json
  {
    "result": {
      "action": "Buy",
      "base": "DOC",
      "base_amount": "1",
      "dest_pub_key": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "method": "request",
      "rel": "MARTY",
      "rel_amount": "2",
      "sender_pubkey": "c213230771ebff769c58ade63e8debac1b75062ead66796c8d793594005f3920",
      "uuid": "288743e2-92a5-471e-92d5-bb828a2303c3"
    }
  }
  ```
</CollapsibleSection>

If you see order data in the response, the order was successfully submitted to the network.

Your swap is not yet started, however.

From here, everything is automated.

If your order is matched you will see something similar in terminal output as the steps of the swap are completed:

When you see that last line, you know that your swap went through! Let's check by checking our DOC [balance](/komodo-defi-framework/api/legacy/my_balance/) again.

<CodeGroup title="" tag="POST" label="my_balance" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
  ```json
  {
    "userpass": "RPC_UserP@SSW0RD",
    "method": "my_balance",
    "coin": "DOC"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CollapsibleSection expandedText="Hide Response" collapsedText="Show Response">

  }
  ```

Congratulations! You have successfully completed your first atomic swap!

Once you are finished using the Komodo DeFi Framework API, you can exit using the [`stop`](/komodo-defi-framework/api/legacy/stop/) method:

<CodeGroup title="" tag="POST" label="stop" mm2MethodDecorate="true">
  ```json
  {
    "userpass": "RPC_UserP@SSW0RD",
    "method": "stop"
  }
