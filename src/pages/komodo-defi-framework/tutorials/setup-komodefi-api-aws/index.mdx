# How to Setup and use the Komodo DeFi Framework API on an AWS EC2 instance

## Create the Komodo DeFi Framework setup script

*   Create a file named `komodo_defi_framework_setup.txt`
*   Copy the code below into the file
*   In the code, find the text, `SEED_WORDS_PLEASE_REPLACE`, and replace it with custom seed words of your own
    *   These seed words are used to generate new blockchain addresses, and therefore the seed words should be treated like a unique password
*   Find the text, `RPC_PASS_PLEASE_REPLACE`, and replace this also with a strong password
    *   This is used to authenticate yourself while communicating with the Komodo DeFi Framework API

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y unzip jq curl
wget $(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/releases | jq -r '.[0].assets[] | select(.name | endswith("Linux-Release.zip")).browser_download_url')
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/master/coins
unzip *Linux-Release.zip
./kdf "{\"netid\":8762,\"gui\":\"aws_cli\",\"passphrase\":\"SEED_WORDS_PLEASE_REPLACE\",\"rpc_password\":\"RPC_PASS_PLEASE_REPLACE\",\"myipaddr\":\"0.0.0.0\"}"
```

## Install AWS CLI , get AWS access credentials

#### Installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install awscli
```

To obtain access credentials, log in to your AWS account and create an IAM user as described in this linked post [https://tntdrive.com/where-do-i-get-my-access-keys.aspx#create-iam-user-and-keys.](https://tntdrive.com/where-do-i-get-my-access-keys.aspx#create-iam-user-and-keys) While following the post, make sure to select the policy `AmazonEC2FullAccess` instead of `AmazonS3FullAccess`. Copy the "Access key ID" and "Secret access key" to another location while completing the post's instructions; these are necessary later.

Make sure the SSH directory exists.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh/
```

## Create an EC2 Instance

Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the file `komodo_defi_framework_setup.txt` is located, and issue the following commands.

In the terminal commands below, note that you must first change the texts `REPLACE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `REPLACE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with your "Access key ID" and "Secret access key" obtained during the setup procedure. If necessary, also change the region where the EC2 instance is hosted by changing all instances of `us-east-1` in the commands.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=REPLACE_ACCESS_KEY_ID
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=REPLACE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
aws ec2 create-key-pair --region us-east-1 --key-name mm2Keypair | jq -r .KeyMaterial > ~/.ssh/kdf.pem
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/kdf.pem
sgID=$(aws ec2 create-security-group --region us-east-1 --group-name sgMM2 --description "sg-kdf"| jq -r '.GroupId')
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --region us-east-1 --group-name sgMM2 --protocol all --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
aws ec2 run-instances --region us-east-1 --image-id ami-083d24fb90054e5f0 --count 1 --instance-type t3.micro --key-name mm2Keypair --security-group-ids $sgID --user-data file://komodo_defi_framework_setup.txt
```

If you see an error similar to the following, click the link that is found in the error. On the page to which your browser is directed click the button "Continue to Subscribe" and then click the button "Accept Terms".

```bash
An error occurred (OptInRequired) when calling the RunInstances operation: In order to use this AWS Marketplace product you need to accept terms and subscribe. To do so please visit https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp?sku=auhljmclkudu651zy27rih2x2

```

Wait for the Subscription to be processed and issue the last command again.

Verify that the instance launched successfully by visiting [this linked page.](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1)

From the linked page above, copy the "IPv4 Public IP" of the instance and use it to replace the text `REPLACE_PUBLIC_IP` in the following command.

```bash
nodeIp=REPLACE_PUBLIC_IP
ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i ~/.ssh/kdf.pem admin@$nodeIp 'curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"RPC_UserP@SSW0RD\",\"method\":\"version\"}"'
```

Edit the command above as necessary to exchange one curl command for another from [the Komodo DeFi Framework API.](/komodo-defi-framework/api/)
