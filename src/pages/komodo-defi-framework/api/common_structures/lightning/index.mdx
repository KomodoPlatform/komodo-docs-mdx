### ConfirmationTargets

This object represents the number of blocks required for an on-chain lightning-related transaction to be confirmed.
It is used for estimating the transaction fee rate (`feerate`) for different transaction types in the context of permissionless transactions performed by the node. Different target types are `background`, `normal`, and `high_priority`.

| Parameter      | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------- | :------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| background     | integer |     ✓    | Used for transactions that can tolerate slower confirmation times when the transaction fee rate decreases. These transactions are not time-sensitive and can afford to wait longer for confirmation. The recommended range is `12` to `144` blocks to ensure a low `feerate`.                                                                                            |
| normal         | integer |     ✓    | Used for transactions that we want to confirm promptly, without significant delay (e.g, transactions for opening payment channels). These transactions are important but not critical. Suggested value is `6` blocks to ensure a moderate `feerate`.                                                                                                                     |
| high\_priority | integer |     ✓    | Used for transactions that require quick confirmation to prevent potential loss of funds (e.g. redeeming a Hashed Time Lock Contract (HTLC) on the blockchain before it times out). These transactions are time-critical and must be confirmed promptly to ensure the security of funds. Recommended value for `high_priority` is 1-2 blocks to ensure a high `feerate`. |

<Note>
  Using the recommended values in the above table with a coin that has a block time of 10 minutes, the equivalent time in minutes is:

  *   `background`: 120 minutes to 1440 minutes (2 hours to 1 day).
  *   `normal`: 60 minutes (one hour).
  *   `high_priority`: 10 to 20 minutes.

| announced\_channel                      | boolean |     ✗    | `false` | Set to announce the channel publicly and notify all nodes that they can route via this channel. GUIs and wallet apps should be set to `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| commit\_upfront\_shutdown\_pubkey       | boolean |     ✗    |  `true` | When `true` (and the counterparty agrees), the user must use the same key for cooperative closing. This prevents a user from changing the destination address in a cooperative close, which slightly increases security (however, this option is not required if the counterparty does not support it and a channel can be accepted regardless). **Note that the key for forced closing is always fixed when opening a channel and is different from shutdown\_pubkey.** |
| counterparty\_locktime                  | integer |     ✗    |  `144`  | The number of blocks we require our counterparty to wait to claim their money on chainif they broadcast a revoked transaction. We have to be online at least once during this time to punish our counterparty for broadcasting a revoked transaction. We have to account also for the time to broadcast and confirm our transaction, possibly with time in between to [RBF (Replace-By-Fee)](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/replace-by-fee/) the spending transaction. |
| negotiate\_scid\_privacy                | integer |     ✗    | `false` | If `true`, we attempt to negotiate the `scid_privacy` (referred to as `scid_alias` in the [BOLTs](https://github.com/lightning/bolts)) option for outbound private channels. This provides better privacy by not including our real on-chain channel UTXO in each invoice and requiring that our counterparty only relay HTLCs to us using the channel's SCID alias.                                                                                                     |
| their\_channel\_reserve\_sats           | boolean |     ✗    | `10000` | The minimum balance that the other node has to maintain on their side, at all times. This ensures that if our counterparty broadcasts a revoked state, we can punish them by claiming at least this value on chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

<Note>
  For GUIs and wallet apps, it is recommended to set `announced_channel` to `false` (the default value), as the node is not expected to be reliably online.
