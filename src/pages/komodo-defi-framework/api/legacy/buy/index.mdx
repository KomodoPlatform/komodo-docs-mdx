# Buy

## buy {{label : 'buy', tag : 'API-v1'}}

The `buy` method issues a buy request and attempts to match an order from the orderbook based on the provided arguments.

<Note>
  *   Buy and sell methods always create the `taker` order first. A `taker` order must pay a `dexfee` during the swap as it is taking liquidity from the market. The `dexfee` is calculated as "the greater of either `Minimum transaction amount (dust) TAKER COIN` or `0.0001 TAKER COIN` or `1/777th` the size of the desired order". If your `GoodTillCancelled` order is not matched in 30 seconds, the order is automatically converted to a `maker` request and stays on the orderbook until the request is matched or cancelled. To always act as a maker, please use the [setprice](/komodo-defi-framework/api/legacy/setprice/) method.
  *   To prevent a user from making trades in which the transaction fees may end up costing a significant portion of the value of the trade, we have set a lower limit to the value of a trade. See the description of the `volume` and `min_volume` arguments for more info.
