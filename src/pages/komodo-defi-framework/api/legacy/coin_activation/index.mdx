# Komodo DeFi Framework Method: Coin Activation

## coin\_activation {{label: 'coin_activation', tag: 'API-v1'}}

<Note type="warning">
  This is a legacy method. For new integrations, use the v2 activation methods.
</Note>

There are two methods of coin activation:

*   `enable` - Connects to a native daemon, or a url which handles RPCs for Platform coins (e.g. ETH, MATIC, FTM, BNB, ONE)
*   `electrum` - Connects to an [electrum server](https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx) for UTXO based coins and QTUM/QRC20 tokens.

A coin can only be activated once per session, and must be activated before it can be used in trading or wallet functions.

<Note type="warning">
  The Komodo DeFi Framework API requires an `mm2` parameter to be set for each `coin`. This can be added to the enable/electrum command, or defined in your [coins file](/komodo-defi-framework/tutorials/api-walkthrough/#setting-up-the-coin-list).

  The value of the `mm2` parameter informs the software as to whether the `coin` is expected to be compatible for atomic swaps.

  *   `0` = `non-compatible`
  *   `1` = `compatible`
</Note>

  Many examples of activation commands are available at [kmd.stats.io](https://stats.kmd.io/atomicdex/activation_commands/)
