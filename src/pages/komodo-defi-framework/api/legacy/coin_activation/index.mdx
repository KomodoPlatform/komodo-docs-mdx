# Coin Activation

## coin\_activation {{label : 'coin_activation', tag : 'overview'}}

<TocForIndex />

<Note>
  The v1 activation methods are deprecated. Please refer to the [v2 coin activation overview](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/coin_activation/) for the latest methods with enhanced functionality and coin protocol support.
</Note>

There are two methods of v1 coin activation:

*   `enable` - Connects to a native daemon, or a url which handles RPCs for Platform coins (e.g. ETH, MATIC, FTM, BNB, ONE)
*   `electrum` - Connects to an [electrum server](https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx) for UTXO based coins and QTUM/QRC20 tokens.

A coin can only be activated once per session, and must be activated before it can be used in trading or wallet functions.

<Note type="warning">
  The Komodo DeFi Framework API requires an `mm2` parameter to be set for each `coin`. This can be added to the enable/electrum command, or defined in your [coins file](/komodo-defi-framework/tutorials/api-walkthrough/#setting-up-the-coin-list).

  The value of the `mm2` parameter informs the software as to whether the `coin` is expected to be compatible for atomic swaps.

  *   `0` = `non-compatible`
  *   `1` = `compatible`
</Note>
