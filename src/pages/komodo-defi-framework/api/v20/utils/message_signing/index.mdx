# Message Signing and Verification Overview

## message\_signing {{label : 'message_signing', tag : 'overview'}}

*   [Sign Message](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/utils/message_signing/sign_message/)
*   [Verify Message](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/utils/message_signing/verify_message/)

Cryptographically signed messages are a useful feature that can be used to [prove ownership of an address](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/25/craig-wright-called-fraud-in-message-signed-with-bitcoin-addresses-he-claims-to-own/).

If your [`coins`](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins) file contains the correct [`sign_message_prefix`](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/77324/how-are-bitcoin-signed-messages-generated/77325#77325) parameter value for a coin, you can sign messages with the [Komodo DeFi Framework API](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework).
For signing with an HD wallet, the [`coins`](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins) file must also contain the coin's [derivation path](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/what-is-a-derivation-path) prefix.

#### Example coin config

    "name": "digibyte",
    "fname": "DigiByte",
    "protocol": {
        "type": "UTXO"
    },
    ...
    "sign_message_prefix": "DigiByte Signed Message:\n",
    "derivation_path": "m/44'/20'",
    "trezor_coin": "DigiByte",
    "links": {
        "github": "https://github.com/digibyte/digibyte",
