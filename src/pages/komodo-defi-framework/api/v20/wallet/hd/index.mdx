# HD Wallets Overview

[Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets](https://atomicdex.io/en/blog/hd-wallet/) are different to other wallets, as they use a key pair management system that allows generating multiple new addresses from a single seed phrase or private key.

`Hierarchical` refers to the structure of HD wallets, which resembles a tree, where parent keys can produce children keys, which can produce grandchildren keys, and so on, all from the same root seed.
`Deterministic` means that the addresses generated in this tree will always be the same for the same root seed phrase.

HD wallets offer several advantages over traditional wallets:

*   Convenience: HD wallets allow users to generate multiple public and private keys from a single seed phrase, making it easier to manage multiple addresses in one place.
*   Privacy: HD wallets can generate new addresses for each transaction, making it more difficult for malicious parties to track a userâ€™s transaction history.
*   Access Control: A user who controls the root seed can create new addresses & keypairs which can be shared with a 3rd party, providing limited or regulated access to funds held under specific pairs.

<Note type="info">
  To use HD wallet functionality with the Komodo DeFi Framework API, you must include `"enable_hd":true` in your [MM2.json file](/komodo-defi-framework/setup/configure-mm2-json/).
  Hardware wallets like [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) are always in HD mode, and this parameter **must** to be set to `true`.
</Note>

In some cases, the methods used to interact with HD wallets are the same as those used with legacy wallets. However, there are some differences, which are detailed in the links below.

## Initialisation and authentication (Hardware wallets only):

*   Initialise connection with your Trezor with [task::init\_trezor::init](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/utils/task_init_trezor/#init)
*   Check the status of the connecton with [task::init\_trezor::status](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/utils/task_init_trezor/#status)
*   Cancel authentication process with [task::init\_trezor::cancel](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/utils/task_init_trezor/#cancel)
*   Authenticate using PIN or phrase with [task::init\_trezor::user\_action](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/utils/task_init_trezor/#user-action)

<Note>
  These methods (and others with a `task::` prefix) will be linked to a numeric
  `task_id` value which is used to query the status or outcome of the task.
</Note>

## UTXO & QTUM Coin Activation in HD Mode:

As HD mode activation performs address scanning to return addresses and balances for enabled accounts, we use `task` methods because fetching this data can take some time.

*   Use [task::enable\_utxo::init](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/coin_activation/task_managed/task_enable_utxo/#init) for UTXO coins like KMD, BTC and DOGE.
*   Check the activation status with [task::enable\_utxo::status](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/coin_activation/task_managed/task_enable_utxo/#status)
*   Authenticate the activation with [task::enable\_utxo::user\_action](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/coin_activation/task_managed/task_enable_utxo/#user-action) (hardware wallet only)
*   Use [task::enable\_qtum::init](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/coin_activation/task_managed/task_enable_qtum/#init) for QTUM Ecosystem coins.
*   Check the activation status with [task::enable\_qtum::status](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/coin_activation/task_managed/task_enable_qtum/#status)
*   Authenticate the activation with [task::enable\_qtum::user\_action](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/coin_activation/task_managed/task_enable_qtum/#user-action) (hardware wallet only)

<Note>
  When using the activation methods with a Trezor, `"priv_key_policy": "Trezor"` needs to be included in the request.
</Note>

## Withdrawing your Funds:

*   Prepare a transaction with [withdraw (v2)](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/tx/withdraw/#withdraw)
*   Broadcast the transaction with [send\_raw\_transaction](/komodo-defi-framework/api/legacy/send_raw_transaction/#send-raw-transaction)
*   Prepare a transaction with [task::withdraw::init](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/task_managed/task_withdraw/#init)
*   Check the status of the transaction preparation with [task::withdraw::status](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/task_managed/task_withdraw/#status)
*   Cancel the transaction preparation with [task::withdraw::cancel](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/task_managed/task_withdraw/#cancel)

## Viewing Hardware Wallet Coin Balances:

*   Initialise the balance request with [task::account\_balance::init](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/hd/task_account_balance/#init)
*   Check the status of the balance request with [task::account\_balance::status](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/hd/task_account_balance/#status)

## Creating New Addresses:

<DevComment>
  # TODO: add this item back after the method is redocumented

  {/* *   Use [can\_get\_new\_address](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/hd/address_management/#can-get-new-address) to determine if your current address has been used, or should be updated. */}
</DevComment>

*   Use [get\_new\_address](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/hd/address_management/#get-new-address) to generate a new address

## Viewing Transaction History:

*   Transaction history using an `account_id` [my\_tx\_history](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/tx/my_tx_history/)
*   Transaction history using an `address_id` [my\_tx\_history](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/tx/my_tx_history/)
