# Query NFT Database Tables

## query\_nft\_database\_tables {{label : 'query_nft_database_tables', tag : 'overview'}}

After using the [update\_nft](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/non_fungible_tokens/update_nft/#update-nft) method to initialise your local NFT database, the following tables are available in `DB/KOMODEFI.db`:

*   AVAX\_nft\_list
*   AVAX\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   BNB\_nft\_list
*   BNB\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   ETH\_nft\_list
*   ETH\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   FTM\_nft\_list
*   FTM\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   MATIC\_nft\_list
*   MATIC\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   scanned\_nft\_blocks

This SQLite database is located under the DB user data folder with each wallet having its own subfolder represented by a hexadecimal string. This string is shown in the runtime logs of the `kdf` binary as `Public key hash` when it starts up.

```bash
30 08:39:23, mm2:269] AtomicDEX API 2.1.0-beta_a81f2a101 DT 2024-07-26T23:24:52+03:00
30 08:39:23, mm2_main::mm2::lp_native_dex:500] INFO Version: 2.1.0-beta_a81f2a101 DT 2024-07-26T23:24:52+03:00
30 08:39:23, crypto::crypto_ctx:324] INFO Public key hash: 7d6cbdd91788df3b764247721fe12853ce36b03d
```

The default location of this folder for each operating system is:

```bash
- Linux: $HOME/.kdf/DB/{'{wallet identifying hex string}'}/MM2.db'
- MacOS: $HOME/.kdf/DB/{'{wallet identifying hex string}'}/MM2.db'
- Windows: %APPDATA%\kdf\DB\{'{wallet identifying hex string}'}\MM2.db'
```

<Note>
  You can define a different location for the DB folder via the [`dbdir` configuration parameter](/komodo-defi-framework/setup/configure-mm2-json/) in your MM2.json file.
  There is also a sqlite database named `MM2.db` which [can be queried for information related to swaps, transactions and other information](/komodo-defi-framework/tutorials/query-the-mm2-database/).
</Note>

There are a variety of methods to query sqlite databases. Examples below show how to do a sqlite query in Linux terminal, but first you might need to install sqlite with `sudo apt install sqlite3`.

The tables and columns available to query in KOMODEFI.db are as follows:

### NFT List tables
