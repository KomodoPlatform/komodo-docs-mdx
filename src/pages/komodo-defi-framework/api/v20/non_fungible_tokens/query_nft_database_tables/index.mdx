# Query NFT database tables

After using the [update\_nft](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/non_fungible_tokens/update_nft/#update-nft) method to initialise your local NFT database,
the following tables are available in `DB/KOMODEFI.db`:

*   AVAX\_nft\_list
*   AVAX\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   BNB\_nft\_list
*   BNB\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   ETH\_nft\_list
*   ETH\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   FTM\_nft\_list
*   FTM\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   MATIC\_nft\_list
*   MATIC\_nft\_transfer\_history
*   scanned\_nft\_blocks

## NFT List tables
