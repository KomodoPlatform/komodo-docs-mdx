## Introduction

The Prices Antara Module offers a decentralized and incentivized margin-trading system on a Smart Chain. This allows users to open long and short leveraged positions against the "House" (the module itself).

A player opens a position with the desired betting amount and leverage. They can close the position anytime and receive the current equity that is in a non-negative state.

When the debt ratio of a player is close to exceeding the allowed limits, other players on the network can liquidate the indebted player's account. The liquidating players thereby receive as an incentive a small percentage of the indebted player's holdings.

For a more detailed explanation of the nature of "leveraged positions" and other terms related to margin trading, please read [this explanation section.](/antara/api/prices/#a-brief-explanation-of-margin-trading-leveraged-trading)

##### The Prices Modules Requires a Separate Technology Called a DTO

The creation of the Prices Antara Module required the existence of a separate Antara-based module that provides trustless and decentralized price feeds. The Komodo community named this separate type of module a "Decentralized Trustless Oracle," or DTO for brevity.

In order to create the trustless and decentralized price feeds, Komodo's DTO technology relies on [timestamp consensus rules](https://medium.com/@jameslee777/decentralized-trustless-oracles-dto-by-piggybacking-on-timestamp-consensus-rules-2adce34d67b6).

The DTO requires the miners of the Smart Chain to include the required off-chain data as a part of the OP\_RETURN in the coinbase transaction (the transaction that pays the block reward to the miner).

The validation of the off-chain data is part of the consensus rules. If the data is false, the block is rejected by the network, which serves as an incentive for the miner to be truthful. To achieve consensus, all nodes allow for an error margin of approximately `1%` in the reported data.

##### Manners of Obtaining Data

The Prices module retrieves prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies through the Antara Customization Parameters [ac\_stocks](/antara/setup/antara-customizations/#ac-stocks) and [ac\_prices](/antara/setup/antara-customizations/#ac-prices), respectively.

The module can extract data from a web source that can be accessed using the `http/https` protocols and return the data as a json object using the [ac\_feeds](/antara/setup/antara-customizations/#ac-feeds) parameter.

The module also has a pre-configured feed that always retrieves values for the pairs `BTC_USD`, `BTC_EUR` and `BTC_GBP`.

The DTO provides the required price feed. For markets, such as `AMZN/KMD`, that do not exist in real life, the DTO offers [synthetic prices](/antara/api/prices/#synthetic-prices-and-their-calculation).

##### Manner of Preventing Miner Manipulation

To counter the possibility of manipulation of price data by a miner (for example, a miner could attempt to take advantage of the `1%` error allowed to win an open bet), when a position is opened the price of purchase is not set until a twenty-four hour period has past. During this period, the module tracks the prices of the relevant currencies. At the end of the period, the module automatically sets the price of purchase for the position based on the price averages.

For long positions, the lock price (also called the "cost basis") is the maximum among averages; for short positions, the lock price is the minimum among averages.

Players should not expect high-speed trading in this type of system.

### A Brief Explanation of Margin Trading ("Leveraged Trading")

Assume Player X has `$100` USD and is certain that Bitcoin (BTC) will soon have a large increase in value relative to USD.

In this type of scenario, Player X can use margin trading to find a greater profit percentage than he would by simply buying `$100` USD worth of BTC and holding it.

However, margin trading increases the risk placed on Player X.

If Player X simply buys his BTC and then sells it after its price increases by `5%`, Player X's profit is `5%`, or `$5` USD. Similarly, the loss is `$5` USD if the price decreases by `5%`.

In a margin-trading system there are two roles: Lender and Trader.

In the example here, Player X is the Trader.

Lender facilitates Trader in borrowing a multiple ("leverage") of the deposited collateral (`$100`). Thereby the Trader can trade using the total amount (deposit + leverage).

For example, Player X desires to trade with a leverage of `10`. This is `$100 * 10 = $1000` USD.

Lender gives Player X the remaining `$900` USD. Player X now buys `$1000` USD worth of BTC.

If the price increases by `5%` and Player X sells their BTC, the profit is `$50` USD.

Player X returns the loan of `$900` and is left with `$150` USD, which amounts to a profit of `50%`.

Alternatively, the price can drop and the Trader can lose higher amounts. In this example, the value of BTC relative to USD drops by `5%`.

Player X now only has `$950` USD worth of BTC. Player X sells and returns the loan amount of `$900` USD, and has `$50` USD remaining.

This is now a loss of `50%`.

In many scenarios, a Lender has the ability to liquidate the Trader at any given time, and will force liquidation before the player can lose more than they are able to immediately repay.

The following stop-loss values are common in margin trading:

*   A `10x` leverage can tolerate up to a `10%` decrease in price before forced liquidation occurs
*   A `100x` leverage can tolerate up to a `1%` decrease in price before forced liquidation occurs

##### Summary of a Brief Explanation to Margin Trading

Assuming `$0` fees, a player can calculate actual profit or loss percentage by the following formula.

```
price change in percent * leverage
```

The Trader's "position" is the amount of coins the player places as a bet.

The Trader's "equity" is the amount of coins the player can withdraw at the current moment. Equity is calculated by the following formula.

```
position + (profit or loss)
```

"Cost basis" is the price at which the bet is opened.

### Synthetic Prices and Their Calculation

The Prices data on a Smart Chain is made available by an active Decentralized Trustless Oracle (DTO), which is comprised of all nodes and miners on the network.

There are limitations to a DTO. For example, the DTO cannot offer price feeds for all possible markets across the world. Furthermore, users on the network may desire a trading pair that does not yet have a real market.

In such cases, price data of two or more different pairs can be used to derive the price of a desired pair. The resulting price data is called a "Synthetic Price."

For example, suppose the DTO for a Smart Chain does not supply the price data for the pair `AMZN/KMD`. However, the chain does supply the price data for the pairs `AMZN/USD`, `USD/BTC` and `BTC/KMD`.

The synthetic price of `AMZN/KMD` is available through considering the prices of all the three pairs.

##### A Forth-like Syntax for Synthetic Calculations

A simple syntax is offered in the Komodo API for calculating synthetic prices and use their value on the Smart Chain.

This syntax is based on the [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_\(programming_language\)) programming language.

In calculating a synthetic price, the Komodo API supports up to three pairs of prices and offers four operations:

*   invert(`!`)
*   multiply(`*`)
*   divide(`/`)

These operations can be supplied with positive and negative integers. The integers allow the calculation of synthetic prices for baskets of assets or indexes. The negative integers can be used to short a price.

For example, the synthetic price of a basket with `3/4` parts BTC and `1/4` parts BCH can be calculated.

#### Usage

The data in each price feed of the DTO has a key that appears in the structure of `AAA_BBB`. This is interpreted to mean that the price for the asset `AAA` is provided in the data in terms of another asset `BBB`.

For example, the price of BTC in terms of USD is denoted by `BTC_USD`

##### Understanding Stacks

Understanding the concept of a stack is essential when using the Komodo API's syntax for calculating synthetic prices.

Stacks are dynamic data structures that follow the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle. In other words, the last item to be inserted into a stack is the first one to be deleted from it.

For example, assume a stack of trays on a table. When a person adds another tray to the stack, they place the tray on top of the stack. When a person removes a tray from the stack, they remove the tray at the top of the stack. Therefore, the last item added to the stack is also the first item removed.

##### Inserting and Deleting Elements

Stacks have restrictions on the insertion and deletion of elements.

Elements can be inserted or deleted only from one end of the stack (the top). The element at the top is called the **top** element.

The operations of inserting and deleting elements are called **push** and **pop** respectively.

When the top element of a stack is deleted, if the stack remains non-empty, the element just below the previous top element becomes the new top element of the stack.

For example, in the stack of trays, if a person takes the tray from the top, the tray just below it automatically becomes the top element.

##### Komodo Stack API Symbols

The allowed symbols in the Komodo API's syntax are:

*   prices
*   operations: invert(`!`), multiply(`*`), divide(`/`)
*   positive and negative integers

The interpretation of the symbols in all the possible cases is described in the subsequent sections.

The Komodo API limits the depth of the stack for prices to three, as this appears to be reasonably sufficient data for calculating synthetic prices.

##### Synthetic Price Weights

A synthetic price is calculated by summing the computed prices with integers that represent `weights`.

The `weight` can be any positive or negative integer whose absolute value is less than `2048`.

After an operator acts on the stack, a weight must be applied to the top element.

If the synthetic price calculation does not require the inclusion of a weight, set the weight's integer value to `1`.

With the weights sets, the module automatically calculates the resulting synthetic price.

###### Example

"BTC\_USD, 3, KMD\_USD, 1" gives the integer weight of `3` to the price pair of `BTC_USD` and the integer weight of `1` to the price pair of `KMD_USD`. The resulting value is described as `BTC_USD*(3/4) + KMD_USD*(1/4)`.

A "spread" in trading is a term that describes the amount or distance between the values of the maximum amount at which a buyer is willing to purchase and the minimum amount at which a seller is willing to sell.

To create a spread, use a negative weight for one of the synthetics.

For example, "BTC\_USD, -2, KMD\_USD, 1" gives the spread: `KMD_USD - 2 * BTC_USD`. When `KMD_USD` gains 2x more than `BTC_USD`, percentage wise, the spread would essentially disappear.

##### Operations Involving 1 Price

| Operator      | Function                                                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!` (inverse) | pops the top stack element, inverts it, and pushes it back on to the stack |

###### Example

"BTC\_USD, !, 1" is computed to "USD\_BTC".

##### Operations Involving 2 Prices

| Operator | Function                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`      | pops two elements from the top of the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result back on to the stack                                                                                       |
| `/`      | pops two elements from the top of the stack, performs a division with the first element as the denominator and the second element as the numerator, and pushes the result back on to the stack |

###### Example

*   "BTC\_USD, USD\_JPY, \*, 1" is computed to "BTC\_JPY"
*   "BTC\_EUR, BTC\_USD, /, 1" is computed to "USD\_EUR"

##### Operations involving 3 prices

Each of these operators act on top of the stack in the order from left to right. It is possible that the value from an earlier computation rests at the top of the stack.

| Operator | Function                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*//`    | pops three elements from the top of the stack, inverts the last two out, multiplies them and pushes the result back on to the stack |
| `**/`    | pops three elements from the top of the stack, inverts the last one out, multiplies them and pushes the result back on to the stack |
| `***`    | pops three elements from the top of the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result back on to the stack                          |
| `///`    | pops three elements from the top of the stack, inverts all of them, multiplies them, and pushes the result back on to the stack     |

## pricesrekt

**pricesrekt bettxid height**

The `pricesrekt` method creates a transaction that liquidates a bet that is "rekt" — a bet where the debt ratio has exceeded maximum limits and is now open to liquidation.

A bet that is rekt has an `IsRekt: 1` flag in its [pricesinfo](/antara/api/prices/#pricesinfo) call.

The `pricesrekt` call requires some proof-of-work (PoW) activity from the machine of the executing user. This deters spamming.

All nodes on the network are incentivised to execute this transaction as it rewards some of the liquidated funds to the node that created the rekt transaction.
