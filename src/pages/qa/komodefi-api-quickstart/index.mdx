# Start using or testing Komodo DeFi Framework quickly

Download the latest release of Komodo DeFi Framework API for your OS from [https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/releases](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/releases)

*   If the latest release tag is `beta-2.0.1683`, the download links should be available at [https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/releases/tag/beta-2.0.1683](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/releases/tag/beta-2.0.1683)
*   Scroll down to the bottom of the page and expand the "Assets" section by clicking on it
*   To download, click on the link that has the words "kdf", "Release" and the name of your OS in it
*   Extract the downloaded file into a new folder named `KomoDeFi`
    *   The directory structure should be something like `KomoDeFi/kdf` i.e., the `kdf` binary should be present in a directory named `KomoDeFi`
*   Open a Terminal and `cd` into the KomoDeFi directory
*   Download the `coins` file; it contains the configuration information for all the supported coins

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoplatform/coins/master/coins
```

*   Download the sample kdf config file

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcharang/mm2scripts/master/MM2_sample.json
```

*   Rename it to `MM2.json` and change the values of the keys `"rpc_password"` and `"passphrase"`
    *   `"rpc_password"`'s value is used to authenticate yourself when sending curl commands
    *   `"passphrase"`'s value is your seed words
*   Start Komodo DeFi Framework API by issuing the following command in a terminal window

```bash
stdbuf -oL nohup ./kdf
```

*   Komodo DeFi Framework (kdf) is up and running

*   You can find all the possible methods accepted by it: [here](/komodo-defi-framework/api/)

*   To easily test/use various methods, open another terminal window and export the `rpc_password`'s value to the environment variable named `userpass`

```bash
export userpass="<value of rpc_password from MM2.json here>"
```

*   Now, find the version of the program using the `version` RPC:

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"method\":\"version\",\"userpass\":\"$userpass\"}"
```
