## Example: Transferring from Chain A to Chain B

Let's walk through an example:

1. In Komodo Wallet, select Chain A as your sending chain.
2. Choose Chain B as your receiving chain.
3. The wallet displays available channels, e.g., "Channel 42".
4. Verify that Channel 42 is marked as active and recommended.
5. Use Channel 42 when prompted during the transfer process.

<Note type="info">
  Channel IDs are specific to each chain pair and direction. The channel for
  sending from Chain A to Chain B may be different from the channel for sending
  from Chain B to Chain A.
</Note>

## Verifying Transfers

After initiating a transfer:

1. Note the transaction hash provided by Komodo Wallet.
2. Use a block explorer for either the sending or receiving chain to track the transaction status.
3. Allow some time for the transfer to complete, as IBC transfers may take longer than on-chain transactions.

## Staying Updated

- Regularly check for updates to the Komodo Wallet application.
- Join official [Komodo community channels](https://komodoplatform.com/discord) to stay informed about any changes to IBC functionality or recommended practices.

By following these steps, you can ensure you're using the correct IBC channel for your transfers on Komodo Wallet, minimizing the risk of failed transactions or lost funds.
