# How to find the right IBC channel for transfers on Komodo Wallet

This guide will help you find the correct IBC channel for making transfers using Komodo Wallet.

<Note type="warning">
  IBC transfer is an advanced feature. Due to the possibility of expired clients
  or network changes, users should approach IBC transfers carefully and ensure
  they are using the most up-to-date channels.
</Note>

## Understanding IBC Channels

### Sources to Find the IBC Channel information

*   [https://ibc.iobscan.io/relayers](https://ibc.iobscan.io/relayers)
*   [https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/relayers?sector=networks](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/relayers?sector=networks)

### Example: Transferring from IRIS to OSMOSIS

<OptimizedImage title="IBC channel information" src={ibcChannels} classNaming="w-full" alt="IBC channel information" />

1.  In Komodo Wallet, select IRIS and open the withdraw form.
2.  Enter the amount and an OSMOSIS address as the destination.
3.  Toggle on the "Set IBC channel" option.
4.  Set the `ibc_source_channel` value to `channel-3` (the channel for IRIS in the above image alongside OSMOSIS).
5.  Send your funds.

<Note type="info">
  Channel IDs are specific to each chain pair and direction. The channel for
  sending from Chain A to Chain B may be different from the channel for sending
  from Chain B to Chain A.
</Note>

## Verifying Transfers

After initiating a transfer:

1.  Note the transaction hash provided by Komodo Wallet.
2.  Use a block explorer for either the sending or receiving chain to track the transaction status.
3.  Allow some time for the transfer to complete, as IBC transfers may take longer than on-chain transactions.

## Staying Updated

*   Regularly check for updates to the Komodo Wallet application.
*   Join official [Komodo community channels](https://komodoplatform.com/discord) to stay informed about any changes to IBC functionality or recommended practices.

By following these steps, you can ensure you're using the correct IBC channel for your transfers on Komodo Wallet, minimizing the risk of failed transactions or lost funds.

To see the API method used behind the scenes for IBC transfers, refer to the [withdraw (v2)](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/wallet/tx/withdraw/) method.
