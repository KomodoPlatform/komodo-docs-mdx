# Import Private Key or Seed Phrase Into Komodo Wallet

First, set a name for your wallet. It can be any string. Doesn't need to be the same name from your previous wallet.

Your mnemonic phrase is important and must be entered precisely. Make sure you keep in mind the following things:

*   There should be no spaces at the beginning or end of the mnemonic phrase
*   There should only be one space between each pair of words
*   Each of the words should be present and spelled exactly as in the [BIP39 word list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bips/master/bip-0039/english.txt)

If using a private key or non-BIP39 compliant seed, you will need to confirm you understand the implications of this by selecting the "Allow custom seed" radio button and typing "I understand" before continuing.

*BIP39 compliant mnemonic seed phrases are from a known word list, and are all lowercase with a single space between words. Spelling is important! Any minor change to a seed will generate a completely different wallet.*

Next, you will need to enter and confirm your wallet password. This password will be used to encrypt and decrypt your seed when launching Komodo Wallet.

P.S: The password can be any valid string. No need to use the same password from your previous wallet.
