Give your wallet a name, and be sure to securely back up the seed phrase offline - it is the key to your coins and should not be shared with anyone!

Click next to confirm the seed phrase. You will be given a series of words and will have to confirm their position within your seed phrase to confirm it has been securely backed up.

Once your seed is confirmed, you will need to enter and confirm your wallet password. This password will be used to encrypt and decrypt your seed when launching Komodo Wallet.
