# Activating Coins in Komodo Wallet

After creating and logging in to your wallet, [Komodo Wallet Desktop](https://komodoplatform.com/en/wallets.html) will launch with [BTC](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [LTC](https://litecoin.org/) and [KMD](https://komodoplatform.com/) enabled by default. To activate additional coins, click on the "Add Crypto" button in the sidebar.

You can use the search bar at the top to filter the list below. Make your selection by clicking on rows in the list. By default there is an activation limit of 50 coins, but you can increase this in settings if more are needed.

As you can see above, even though [ETH](https://ethereum.org/) was not selected, it was activated alongside the Shiba Inu ERC-20 token. Anytime you activate a protocol token, its parent coin will also be activated. For example if activating [MINDS](https://www.minds.com/) token, it will automatically also enable [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/).
