# Viewing Your Wallet Address in Komodo Wallet Desktop

Before you can start trading on [Komodo Wallet](https://atomicdex.io/), you will need to add some funds to your wallet.

To see your address for a coin, first log in to your wallet, then select a coin by clicking on its row from the Portfolio page.

Alternatively, you can click on the wallet icon in the left navigation menu and then select a coin from the coins list on the left. If you cant see the coin you want to send funds to, [make sure it has been activated](https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/activating-coins-in-atomicdex-desktop/571) first.

If you click on the "Receive" button a modal will appear with your wallet address, which you can copy and share with someone to send you funds, and a QR code which you can scan to send funds from a mobile wallet.
