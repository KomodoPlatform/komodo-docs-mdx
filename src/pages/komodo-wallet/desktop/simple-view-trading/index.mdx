# Simple View Trading on Komodo Wallet Desktop

Once you have created a wallet and added funds, you are ready to use the Komodo Wallet trading features.
There are two views for trading:

*   **Simple**: which will match you with the best order available for a selected pair
*   **Pro**: which shows more information about orders available on the orderbook and more options to customize when placing your order.

To use the Simple view, log in and click on the "DEX" icon in the navigation menu on the left.

Now you can click "Confirm" to initiate the swap! This will move us to the "Orders" tab, which lists any in-progress or not yet started trades we are currently involved in. When a order is being matched, it will briefly disappear from the list. You can click on the order to view its progress.

Here you will see the swap duration, and if the swap is in progress, which step it is on and an estimate of how long until complete. Once completed, the swap will move to the list under the "History" tab.

Here you can review past swaps, and the swap details modal will include a "View on explorer" button. If you click on it a browser tab showing the transactions for the swap on a block explorer will open.
