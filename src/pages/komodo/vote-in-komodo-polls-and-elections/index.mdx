# How to Vote in Komodo Polls and Elections

From time to time, a community poll will be held for KMD holders to vote on. Details and options for these polls will be published in the [KIPs repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/kips) or [Notary Node Candidates repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/notaryNodes) and broadcast via the [KomodoPlatform twitter](https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform), weekly emails and [blog](https://komodoplatform.com/en/blog/).

Following a snapshot of the KMD blockchain, vote tokens are airdropped to all holders of KMD, equivalent to the amount of KMD held at the time of the snapshot (funds held in CEX wallets are excluded). Holders can vote using any supporting wallet, or via the command line.

To find the command line launch parameters for active KIP chains, refer to the [dPoW repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/master/iguana/assetchains.old)
