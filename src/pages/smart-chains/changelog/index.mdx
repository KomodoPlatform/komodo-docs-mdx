# Change Log

## v0.9.0

We are happy to announce the release of `0.9.0`. This release includes binaries that you can download below.

This is a **mandatory** major version that **does** include breaking changes.

This release includes the new elected notary node [pubkeys for S8](https://komodoplatform.com/en/blog/official-results-eighth-annual-notary-node-election/) (Season 8), along with other important consensus changes and improvements such as [KIP0002](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/kips/blob/main/kips/kip-0002.mediawiki) (KMD Block Reward Reduction proposal) and [KIP0003](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/kips/blob/main/kips/kip-0003.mediawiki) (KMD Transaction Fee Increase and Burn), both of which were [voted](https://komodoplatform.com/en/blog/2024-kip-results/) on and accepted by the Komodo community. As a result, this is a hard-forking release, making it **mandatory** for everyone.

S8 (Season 8) will commence at KMD block `4125988`, which is expected around `Fri Oct 4, 2024, 13:37:33 GMT+0000`. Nodes that are not updated in time will not follow the KMD and assetchains mainnet. Therefore, it is obligatory to update by the mentioned date.

**Full Changelog**: [https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0)

## v0.8.1 \[Falkor]

*   This update is mandatory and includes several security fixes, code refactoring, optimizations, and other improvements.
*   Update Rust compiler to 1.69.
*   Add notarisations specific unit tests.
*   Refactoring the legacy code that is associated with PAX, KV, and ratification transactions has resulted in a slight decrease in block verification and overall synchronization time.
*   Bump libcurl to 8.4.0 ([CVE-2023-38545](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7xw9-w465-6x42), [CVE-2023-38546](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x3qx-m3c2-qfhx) fix).
*   Fix the value pools (sprout, sapling) calculation issue.
*   Minor fixes and updates.

## v0.8.0-beta1 \[Viserion]

*   This is a mandatory update, Komodo Season 7 HF planned on height `3484958` for KMD, and timestamp `1688132253` (`Fri Jun 30 2023 13:37:33 GMT+0000`) for assetchains. All wallets/nodes should be updated to the latest (`0.8.0`) software to continue following mainnet.
*   Reduce AUR 5% -> 0.01% (start from S7), as it announced in [KIP-0001](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/kips/blob/main/kip-0001.mediawiki).
*   Memory Usage Improvement: The memory usage of `komodod` has been reduced by not keeping Equihash solutions for all block headers in memory.
*   Node Startup Performance Improvements.
*   Security fixes.
*   Upgrade project dependencies (libevent).
*   Add `z_gettreestate` rpc.
*   Minor fixes and updates.

## v0.7.2 \[Longpan]

*   This is a mandatory update, Komodo Season 6 HF planned on height 2963330 for KMD, and timestamp 1656077853 (Fri Jun 24 2022 13:37:33 GMT+0000) for assetchains. All wallets/nodes should be updated to the latest (0.7.2) software to continue following mainnet.
*   Fix build with new glibc 2.34 on Linux platforms.
*   Fix unoptimized depends build (bdb, boost, protobuf, zeromq).
*   Remove Verus (VRSC) legacy code: VerusHash, VerusHash 1.1, Verus POS/stake, etc. Chains which used VerusHash as primary algo, like LUMBER will be incompatible with new version of daemon.
*   Code refactoring. Perfomance boost on some operations.
*   Restore -exchange command line arg for an exchanges (this will disable interest/reward calculations and will set nLockTime in newly created transactions to zero).
*   Fix / refactor komodo\_block\_prg and komodo\_block\_unlocktime internals logic, get rid of VerusHash usage in it. Starting from this release all chains using -ac\_timeunlockfrom, -ac\_timeunlockto, -ac\_timelockgte will be incompatible with new daemon (there was no well-known public blockchains using these features). Newly created blockchains (ACs) using these parameters will work without any limitations on 0.7.2 and higher versions of software.
*   hf22 / hfnet consensus changes and fixes, related to well-known issues of long-gaps between blocks, disappearing txes from mempool in-case of big gaps between blocks, etc. These changes aimed to improve the network stability, help to get rid of such gaps, and make txes propagation more reliable and stable.
*   Minor fixes and updates.
