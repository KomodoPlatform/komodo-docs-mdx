# Jumblr

<Note>
  At this time, all zero-knowledge transaction and Jumblr functionality on the main KMD chain is disabled.

  Other Smart Chains in the Komodo ecosystem offer zero-knowledge transaction functionality. However, no Smart Chain currently offers Jumblr, and therefore this documentation is currently deprecated.

  Please check with the developers of your desired Smart Chain to learn more.
</Note>

The following RPC calls interact with the `komodod` software, and are made available through the `komodo-cli` software.

## Basic Instructions

*   Install Komodo following the [installation guides](/smart-chains/setup/installing-from-source/#linux) and change into the `komodod` subdirectory using:

```bash
cd ~/komodo/src
```

*   Start the daemon:

```bash
./komodod &
```

*   Designate a KMD address with at least 10.024 KMD funds:

```bash
./komodo-cli jumblr_deposit KMD_address
```

<Note>
  The jumblr process continues until there are less than \~ 10.024 KMD in the
  deposit address.
</Note>

*   Designate a destination address for your funds. This should be a transparent address that you are keeping secret:

```bash
komodo-cli jumblr_secret destination_KMD_address
```

*   Leave your node running until the balance in your first address reaches below 10.024 KMD and the destination address receives the correct amount.

<Note type="warning">
  Jumblr is created to be resistant against time-based analysis. Because of
  this, Jumblr is purposefully designed not to be fast. You will need to leave
  your node running for several hours for the process to finish.
</Note>

#### ðŸ“Œ Examples

Designate your deposit address.

```bash
./komodo-cli jumblr_deposit RT4mSUjG35QeuGcedsfpHtP5MhDeEGTAqb
```

Designate your secret destination address.

```bash
./komodo-cli jumblr_secret RS46GZ5iTkt2exdauQG3JJ8fdnZNJUvAc1
```

## jumblr\_deposit

**jumblr\_deposit "depositaddress"**

The `jubmlr_deposit` method indicates the address from which Jumblr should withdraw funds. There should be at least 10.024 KMD in this address. Jumblr will withdraw funds in increments of 10, 100, or 7770 KMD.

<Note>
  While shielded z\_address technology is available on all KMD-based Smart
  Chains, the Jumblr engine and methods are only available on the KMD mainnet.

## jumblr\_secret

**jumblr\_secret "secretaddress"**
