## Komodo DeFi Framework v2.0.0-beta

### Network Evolution & KMD Burn: Enhancing KMD's Role in Komodo's DeFi Framework

Introducing pivotal network enhancements to pave the way for an evolved DEX P2P network, Komodo DeFi Framework 2.0.0-beta marks a strategic step forward. This release not only streamlines network performance but also introduces a deflationary aspect to KMD, underscoring its utility and value in Komodo Platform's expanding ecosystem.

### Release Notes

**Features:**

*   KMD Burn:
    *   Burning 25% of the taker fee when paid in KMD was implemented by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#2006](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2006)
*   Swap watcher nodes (only for UTXO/UTXO swaps):
    *   For UTXO/UTXO swaps, watcher nodes will either complete the swap for taker or refund the taker payment if the taker goes offline after sending their payment. This was implemented by [@caglaryucekaya](https://github.com/caglaryucekaya) in [#1457](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1457) [#1496](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1496) [#1523](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1523) [#1552](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1552)
    *   Using watcher nodes for swaps were enabled by default for UTXO/UTXO swaps by [@caglaryucekaya](https://github.com/caglaryucekaya). All nodes doing a swap will broadcast a watcher message after the taker payment is sent if both coins swapped are supported by watchers (currently only UTXO) [#1859](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1859)

**Enhancements:**

*   Network Enhancements:
    *   P2P layer was upgraded to use the latest stable libp2p version by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#1878](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1878)
    *   `7777` network was deprecated by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#2020](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2020).
    *   Seednodes for `netid` `8762` were updated by [@smk762](https://github.com/smk762) [#2024](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2024)
    *   `libp2p-yamux` was updated by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) to use yamux `v0.13` (new version) by default and to fall back to yamux `v0.12` (old version) when setting any configuration options [#2030](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2030)
    *   The backpressure buffer cap was increased from `25` to `256` by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#2030](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2030)
    *   New protocol version (Version2) was added by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) to be used for peer exchange and request-response behaviours in [#2030](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2030)
    *   Network information is now written to stdout so users can find mm2 ports easily [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) [#2034](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2034)
*   NFT feature was released in [v1.0.6-beta](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/releases/tag/v1.0.6-beta), this release adds significant enhancements to this feature:
    *   `exclude_spam` and `exclude_phishing` params were added for `get_nft_list` and `get_nft_transfers` RPCs by [@laruh](https://github.com/laruh) [#1959](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1959)
    *   Spam transfers with empty meta was fixed by [@laruh](https://github.com/laruh) to no longer update [#1989](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1989)
*   `version` method was added to `PUBLIC_METHODS` that require no login by [@smk762](https://github.com/smk762) [#2001](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2001)
*   An additional `PRICE_ENDPOINTS` url which is a cached copy of `https://prices.komodian.info/api/v2/tickers` and is updated every minute was added by [@smk762](https://github.com/smk762) [#2032](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2032)

**Bug Fixes:**

*   ARRR/Pirate:
    *   ARRR infrastructure for lightwallet servers uses a fork of `lightwalletd`, the grpc service was renamed by [@smk762](https://github.com/smk762) `from cash.z.wallet.sdk.rpc` to `pirate.wallet.sdk.rpc` to use the `lightwalletd` fork [#1963](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1963)
    *   Previous blocks/wallet sync was fixed by [@borngraced](https://github.com/borngraced) to be resumed if `sync_params` are not provided after restart [#1967](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/issues/1967)
*   EVM web3 requests timeout was reduced to 20s by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1973](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1973)
*   Fixed `0.0001` min threshold for TakerFee was removed by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1971](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1971)
*   The minimum trading volume for evm and tendermint was changed to be the smallest possible amount of the coin by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1971](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1971)
*   Minimum trading price was reduced by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) to be any value above 0 [#1971](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1971)
*   `Cryptocondition` script type was added to utxo transactions by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1991](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1991)
*   On response error the next web3 node is now tried [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1998](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1998)
*   Watchtower taker-side restart bug was fixed by [@caglaryucekaya](https://github.com/caglaryucekaya) [#1908](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1908)
*   `rpcport` value can now accept a string [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#2026](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/2026)

### NB - Backwards compatibility breaking changes

*   `7777` Network deprecation and the upgrade to a new p2p layer breaks compatibility with previous versions of Komodo DeFi Framework. Connections between nodes/clients running an older version of Komodo DeFi Framework and nodes/clients running this version will not be possible. To avoid this, all nodes/clients must be upgraded to the latest version of Komodo DeFi Framework.
*   Because of KMD burn of a part of the taker fee, the taker fee outputs for any `coin/KMD` swap are changed and makers running older versions will not be able to validate the taker fee, this will cause the swap to fail. This case will never happen anyway because older versions will not be able to connect to this latest version due to the network upgrade.
*   Because of the removal of the fixed 0.0001 min threshold for TakerFee, taker fee validation will also fail for these cases. Again, this case will never happen as the previous case.

## Komodo DeFi Framework v1.0.7-beta

**Enhancements:**

*   Using a specific start date for Pirate/ARRR synchronization was added by [@borngraced](https://github.com/borngraced). This allows users to specify a specific date as the starting point for synchronization as a substitute for the checkpoint block from config or syncing from the first block [#1922](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1922)

**Bug Fixes:**

*   PoSV coins withdrawal was fixed by [@reddink](https://github.com/reddink). The issue was a missing n\_time field in the generated transaction. The fix now correctly considers when n\_time is required, and the rawtransaction can be broadcasted [#1925](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1925)
*   Tendermint tests were fixed by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) by using latest relayer channel [#1929](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1929)

*   A fix was introduced by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) to use kmd rewards for fees if change + interest is below dust threshold [#1944](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1944)
*   Debug info was removed from release binary by [@onur-ozkan](https://github.com/onur-ozkan) to reduce the file size [#1954](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1954)
*   Failing tests due to BCHD were ignored by [@shamardy](https://github.com/shamardy) [#1955](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/pull/1955)

    *   A CI job was added to check if mm2 version was bumped before merging any pull request to main in [#1899](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/issues/1899)
