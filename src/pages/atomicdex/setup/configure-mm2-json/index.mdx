# AtomicDEX API configuration

AtomicDEX-API configuration parameters are [listed in the source code](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2.1/mm2src/mm2.rs#L126), along with [additional runtime flags](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2.1/mm2src/mm2.rs#L115), and [per-process environment variables](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2.1/mm2src/mm2.rs#L171)

## MM2.json

When running the AtomicDEX API via commandline with the `mm2` binary, some basic configuration parameters need to be defined in either an `MM2.json` file, or at runtime.

| Parameter              | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gui                    | string          | Information to identify which app, tool or product is using the API, e.g. `AtomicDEX iOS 1.0.1`. Helps developers identify if an issue is related to specific builds or operating systems etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| netid                  | integer         | Nework ID number, telling the AtomicDEX-API which network to join. 7777 is the current main network, though alternative netids can be used for testing or "private" trades as long as seed nodes exist to support it.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| passphrase             | string          | Your passphrase; this is the source of each of your coins private keys. [**KEEP IT SAFE!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFpxVbTqhB8)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| rpc_password           | string          | For RPC requests that need authentication, this will need to match the `userpass` value in the request body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| allow_weak_password    | boolean         | Optional, defaults to `false`. If `true`, will allow low entropy rpc_password. If `false` rpc_password must not have 3 of the same characters in a row, must be between 8-32 characters in length, must contain at least one of each of the following: numeric, uppercase, lowercase, special character (e.g. !#$\*). It also can not contain the word "password", or the chars `<`, `>`, or `&`. |
| dbdir                  | string          | Optional, defaults to a subfolder named `DB` in the path of your `mm2` binary. This path will store the AtomicDEX-API database data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| rpcip                  | string          | Optional, defaults to `127.0.0.1`. IP address to bind to for RPC server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| rpcport                | integer         | Optional, defaults to `7783`. Port to use for RPC communication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| rpc_local_only         | boolean         | Optional, defaults to `true`. If `false` the AtomicDEX API will allow rpc methods sent from external IP addresses. **Warning:** Only use this if you know what you are doing, and have put the appropriate security measures in place.                                                                                                                                                            |
| i_am_seed              | boolean         | Optional, defaults to `false`. Runs AtomicDEX API as a seed node mode (acting as a relay for AtomicDEX API clients). Use of this mode is not reccomended on the main network (7777) as it could result in a pubkey ban if non-compliant. On alternative testing or private networks, at least one seed node is required to relay information to other AtomicDEX API clients using the same netID. |
| seednodes              | list of strings | Optional. If operating on a test or private netID, the IP address of at least one seed node is required (on the main network, these are already hardcoded)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| hd_account_id          | integer         | Optional. If this value is set, the AtomicDEX-API will work in only the [HD derivation mode](/atomicdex/api/v20-dev/hd_wallets_overview), and coins will need to have a coin derivation path entry in the `coins` file for activation. The `hd_account_id` value effectively takes its place in the full derivation as follows: `m/44'/COIN_ID'/<hd_account_id>'/CHAIN/ADDRESS_ID`                 |
| message_service_cfg    | object          | Optional. This data is used to configure [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) messenger alerts for swap events when running using the [makerbot functionality](/atomicdex/api/v20/start_simple_maker_bot). For more information check out the [telegram alerts guide](/atomicdex/api/v20/telegram_alert)                                                                                             |
| metrics                | integer         | Optional. Defaults to `300`. The interval in seconds which metrics are logged. Set to `0` to disable metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| prometheusport         | integer         | Optional. Only used if you are logging metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). For more information check out the [AtomicDEX metrics guide](/atomicdex/api/tutorials/atomicdex-metrics)                                                                                                                                                              |
| prometheus_credentials | integer         | Optional. Only used if you are logging metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) with authentication. For more information check out the [AtomicDEX metrics guide](/atomicdex/api/tutorials/atomicdex-metrics)                                                                                                                                          |

## Coins file configuration

You can download and use [this file](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins) as a starting point for your own `coins` file. It contains all of the coins that are currently supported by the AtomicDEX API, and is maintained by the Komodo Platform team.
The structure for adding additiona coins can vary, please refer to the [listing guide](/atomicdex/tutorials/listing-a-coin-on-atomicdex) or [contact the KomodoPlatform team](https://komodoplatform.com/discord) for assistance.
