          description: 'There are two types from which to choose: `GoodTillCancelled`
            and `FillOrKill`. The `GoodTillCancelled` order is automatically converted
            to a `maker` order if the order is not matched in 30 seconds, and this
            `maker` order stays in the orderbook until explicitly cancelled. On the
            other hand, a `FillOrKill` order is cancelled if it is not matched within
            30 seconds. The default type is `GoodTillCancelled`'
