        background:
          type: integer
          description: Used for transactions that can tolerate slower confirmation
            times when the transaction fee rate decreases. These transactions are
            not time-sensitive and can afford to wait longer for confirmation. The
            recommended range is `12` to `144` blocks to ensure a low `feerate`.
        normal:
          type: integer
          description: Used for transactions that we want to confirm promptly, without
            significant delay (e.g, transactions for opening payment channels). These
            transactions are important but not critical. Suggested value is `6` blocks
            to ensure a moderate `feerate`.
        high_priority:
          type: integer
          description: Used for transactions that require quick confirmation to prevent
            potential loss of funds (e.g. redeeming a Hashed Time Lock Contract (HTLC)
            on the blockchain before it times out). These transactions are time-critical
            and must be confirmed promptly to ensure the security of funds. Recommended
            value for `high_priority` is 1-2 blocks to ensure a high `feerate`.
