      description: 'Defines the private key management policy for a coin or token.
        Used in activation and wallet-related requests to specify how private keys
        are handled.


        **Values:**

        - `Iguana`: The legacy private key policy. One-to-one mapping of private keys
        to addresses. Only a single key and corresponding address is activated per
        coin, without hierarchical deterministic derivation.

        - `HDWallet`: The HD Wallet private key policy. Uses a BIP44 derivation path
        up to the coin level and manages keys using an HD Wallet scheme.

        - `Trezor`: The Trezor hardware wallet private key policy. Key management
        is handled by the Trezor device.

        - `Metamask`: (WASM only) The Metamask private key policy. Used when interfacing
        with the Metamask extension in web-based contexts.

        - `WalletConnect`: The WalletConnect private key policy. Represents key management
        for connections established via WalletConnect, including both compressed and
        uncompressed public keys and the session topic.
