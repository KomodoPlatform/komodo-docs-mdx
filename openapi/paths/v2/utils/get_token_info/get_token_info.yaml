                  the value of inputs to be used in the case of order creation or
                  a `withdraw` transaction. The default value used for a UTXO type
                  coin (Bitcoin protocol) is `8`, and the default value used for an
                  ERC20 token is `18`. It is **very important** for this value to
                  be set correctly. For example, if this value was set as `9` for
                  BTC, a command to withdraw `1 BTC` tries to withdraw `10^9` satoshis
                  of Bitcoin, i.e., `10 BTC`.
