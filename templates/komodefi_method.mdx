# Category Heading

The category heading is optional, an used for pages with multiple related methods. This section should include a brief description of the category, and links to each method section of the page.


## Method Heading {{label : 'method_name', tag : 'API-v2'}}

The `method_name` method has a description about what it is used for and it will be written here. 
The method heading can be slightly different to the method name if it makes it easier to understand.
The anchor URL to be used in the sidebar will be the same as the method heading, with `-` im plce of a space between words, for example `/path/to/file#method-heading`.
Limitations, if any, will be mentioned. There might also be links to related methods, notes, or more information about the feature this method helps to implement.
If there are optional paramaters which need a more detailed explanation, it should go here to avoid cluttering the table below.
